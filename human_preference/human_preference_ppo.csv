TITLE: TIFU by accidently kicking an old woman
POST: So this didn't happen today but actually about a year or two ago.

I was at my granddads funeral so of course it was all very sad and full of lots of crying old people. After the ceremony everyone walks outside the building and onto the other side of the small road the hearses drive down. Now the road is important because obviously if there's a road, there's a curb onto the sidewalk, so most of us are on the other side of the road, besides a few older people walking a lot slower. 

As one of the old woman goes to walk up the curb she trips (obviously didn't notice there was one due to crying and whatnot) and I'm the only one who not only sees it coming but is in any position to do anything. So of course as someone who is an avid football (soccer if you're American) player my first instinct is to stick my foot out and kind of control her head like you would with a football.

Of course you can imagine this looked horrendously bad on my part (quite literally kicking an old woman while she's down) and as she got up everyone noticed that her nose was completely grey/black as if she'd just been punched in the face. She assures us she's fine and we go to the dinner afterwards where someone finally informs her of her bruising. She goes to the toilet and comes out with a completely normal looking nose so of course everyone's wondering how and it turns out that the ""bruising"" was actually shoe polish from my shoe, confirming to everyone that i kicked this poor old lady square in the face as she fell.
TL;DR:  [Tried to stop an old lady falling, kicked her in the face, made her look like she'd been 3 rounds with Mike Tyson]","Article 1

TITLE: I [32 M] found out my wife [31 F] had an affair a year and a half ago, now I can't stop thinking about other women.
POST: Wife and I moved accross the country with our two daughters <our dream.  

We settle in, happy, rosey veiws, living the dream or so I though.  6mo later she sleeps with a co-worker. I find out about it four months later on my birthday. Shit hits the fan at home and work - she and d-bag are fired. Did I mention she work for a Christian organization?

Fast forward 18 months - today. I don't have a marrage - rather - a roomate who's the mother of my children.  She's too fragile to say I want out, but I want out.

Do I pursue an ""affair"" or just flip the world upside down my kids and leave?
TL;DR:  [Wife Cheats on me but I stuck around for kids.  I want out - do I have an affair or break it off and ruin my kids world?]","Article 2

TITLE: Caffeine addiction. Anyone taking vitamins or supplements with caffeine?
POST: I have a horrible caffeine addiction, and I don't like sacrificing any of my daily calories for coffee. I used to drink 5-6 Diet Dr. Peppers a day, but I have switched to almost exclusively drinking only water most days. I do have a Diet Dr. Pepper occasionally, and I know that technically it's okay to probably have one a day, but I honestly just feel better all around when I drink only water. But if I don't have some caffeine in the morning, I will be writhing in the floor in pain with a skull-pounding headache by mid-day. I know. Ridiculous, right? 

So, I went to the vitamin aisle the other day in search of a supplement with a little caffeine and the only thing I found was One A Day Adult Vitacraves Gummies with Energy Support. Here's the website with [nutritional info] One serving is 20 calories and has 90 mg of caffeine. There's also some vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid in there that supposedly helps turn food into energy. I have no idea if that's true. I've been taking them a couple days, and so far I do feel more energized and I haven't had any headaches. The issue is that one bottle is around $9 and there are only 60 in a bottle. You have to take 4 (4!) a day, which is very intriguing considering the brand name and all. So it'll cost me around $20 a month. Which is admittedly cheaper than what I used to spend on Diet Dr. Peppers, but still. I was just curious if anyone else had a better option for caffeine in a supplement or vitamin?
TL;DR:  [The vitamin with caffeine I'm taking is on the expensive side, and I'm a self-proclaimed tightwad. Anyone have better options?]","Article 3
