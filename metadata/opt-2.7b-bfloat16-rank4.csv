TITLE: Me [19 F] with my friend [19 M], not sure if I may have messed things up already.
POST: Hello hello everybody. I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).

Okay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.

Okay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. 

We ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.

Yesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to ""play it by ear"" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.
TL;DR: ","I really like this guy, but after having sex with him after only knowing him for a very brief period of time, I am worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship with him.","Fwbs, casual, not serious, but is this guy interested or just a plaything? What do you guys think?"

TITLE: My 11 year old sons friend died suddenly, his funeral is today and my son suddenly doesn't want to attend.
POST: **repost from relationships**

A couple of weeks ago my sons friend died in a freak accident, it was completely shocking and horrific. He isn't aware of the details, but we broke the news to him as soon as we found out and have spoke about it many times with him.

He has cried about it, asked questions and spoken about it with his older siblings (who have also recently lost a friend) and seemed to be okay with it (considering the circumstances).

Leading up to the funeral, we have talked about it and explained what he is to expect, etc. This is his first funeral, so we have made sure that he is aware of everything.

But today is the day, and he has broken down in the morning and says he doesn't want to go. I have no idea what to do. Do I push him to go? I am worried that he will regret it later, as he is a kid who doesn't like to do new things. But at the same time, I don't want to pressure him to do something he doesn't want to do.
Advice, please?

TITLE: TIFU by accidently kicking an old woman
POST: So this didn't happen today but actually about a year or two ago.

I was at my granddads funeral so of course it was all very sad and full of lots of crying old people. After the ceremony everyone walks outside the building and onto the other side of the small road the hearses drive down. Now the road is important because obviously if there's a road, there's a curb onto the sidewalk, so most of us are on the other side of the road, besides a few older people walking a lot slower. 

As one of the old woman goes to walk up the curb she trips (obviously didn't notice there was one due to crying and whatnot) and I'm the only one who not only sees it coming but is in any position to do anything. So of course as someone who is an avid football (soccer if you're American) player my first instinct is to stick my foot out and kind of control her head like you would with a football.

Of course you can imagine this looked horrendously bad on my part (quite literally kicking an old woman while she's down) and as she got up everyone noticed that her nose was completely grey/black as if she'd just been punched in the face. She assures us she's fine and we go to the dinner afterwards where someone finally informs her of her bruising. She goes to the toilet and comes out with a completely normal looking nose so of course everyone's wondering how and it turns out that the ""bruising"" was actually shoe polish from my shoe, confirming to everyone that i kicked this poor old lady square in the face as she fell.

TITLE: Caffeine addiction. Anyone taking vitamins or supplements with caffeine?
POST: I have a horrible caffeine addiction, and I don't like sacrificing any of my daily calories for coffee. I used to drink 5-6 Diet Dr. Peppers a day, but I have switched to almost exclusively drinking only water most days. I do have a Diet Dr. Pepper occasionally, and I know that technically it's okay to probably have one a day, but I honestly just feel better all around when I drink only water. But if I don't have some caffeine in the morning, I will be writhing in the floor in pain with a skull-pounding headache by mid-day. I know. Ridiculous, right? 

So, I went to the vitamin aisle the other day in search of a supplement with a little caffeine and the only thing I found was One A Day Adult Vitacraves Gummies with Energy Support. Here's the website with [nutritional info] One serving is 20 calories and has 90 mg of caffeine. There's also some vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid in there that supposedly helps turn food into energy. I have no idea if that's true. I've been taking them a couple days, and so far I do feel more energized and I haven't had any headaches. The issue is that one bottle is around $9 and there are only 60 in a bottle. You have to take 4 (4!) a day, which is very intriguing considering the brand name and all. So it'll cost me around $20 a month. Which is admittedly cheaper than what I used to spend on Diet Dr. Peppers, but still. I was just curious if anyone else had a better option for caffeine in a supplement or vitamin?
TL;DR: ","The vitamin with caffeine I'm taking is on the expensive side, and I'm a self-proclaimed tightwad. Anyone have better options?","Caffeine addict here. I'm trying to lose weight (about 3 lbs) and I have been drinking plenty of water and my workouts are very strenuous, so I want to take some caffeine, but I don't want to sacrifice my calorie intake for it."

TITLE: TIFU by eating a banana.
POST: So, this actually happened yesterday. I am currently studying abroad in a tropical country. As a result, the selection of locally grown fruit is phenomenal. Now, I'm not usually one for bananas, but I keeping hearing they are much more flavorful here, so I decided I'd give it a go and bought a small bunch from the local market. Yesterday morning, I decided I'd have one for breakfast along with my usual corn flakes. After I wash it down with coffee, I immediately start feeling like crap, but one of my roommates had a stomach bug over the weekend, so I just automatically assume that I must have contracted said bug and rush off to my four hour class. Four hours of hell, that is. As soon as I sit down, my nose becomes a waterfall with off and on sneezing fits. Next, cue the most god awful indigestion and acid reflux I have ever experienced. I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping. Once I get up, I discover that I have a nice little rash starting in each armpit, which I chalk up to having switched deodorants just that morning. Finish off a bottle of Maalox with some advil and commenced sleep attempt number two. I wake up a little more clear headed this time and begin to assess my situation. The rash is now worse and I start wondering, what if the deodorant didn't cause the rash? Is there a single thing that could possibly explain all of my symptoms? I started to ask myself out loud, ""Did I eat anything today that I don't usually..... oh, shit."" In an instant my fingers were flying on Google to search ""banana allergy"" only to find a multitude of symptom lists that pretty much specifically described my day of hell. By this time, my face had even started to swell a bit, but now knowing what I  was up against, I bought some benedryl, had a couple of beers and went back to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling much better, and unlike Pam Poovey, I will not continue to stuff my face with foods I know I am allergic to. No more bananas. Ever.
TL;DR: ","I don't usually eat bananas, but decided to have one for breakfast since I'm studying abroad in a tropical country and the bananas are supposedly better here, unaware that I am apparently highly allergic.

TITLE: Wife's ""friend"" is stealing money.  Any ideas on how to approach this?
POST: So my wife has a friend that I will call Julie.  My wife and Julie have been friends for about 6 years if I remember correctly.  Julie is a shit friend in my opinion and I have told the wife my feelings.  When they lived together Julie would start physical fights with my wife and spat on my wife's face once.  Now when Julie comes over to our house there is a 98% chance that something will be broken and really really dirty when she leaves.
Julie does not have any other good close friends in our town and her closest family is 5 hours away.  I am thinking that is why my wife doesn't get rid of Julie.  About 7 months ago we were all outside and Julie said that she needed to go inside to use the restroom.  As we soon outside I noticed that our bedroom light turned on, stayed on for less than a minute, and then went off.  
Later that night after Julie left when the wife and I went inside and the wife discovered that her purse had been moved and that she was missing $20.  I looked at my stuff and my checkbook had been moved.  The only other person in our house that night was Julie and she was left alone.
On Saturday my wife went shopping with Julie.  Again for some reason my wife left her purse with Julie alone.  Today my wife was trying to buy gas and is now missing $30.  
Before Julie started to steal from us her car battery died and she called us.  Stupidly I paid for and installed a new one for her.  I still haven't been paid back for that $87.
I am trying to figure out if it is time for me to say something to Julie or do I let the wife handle it?

TITLE: TIFU bY brushing with Baking Soda without learning how to do it correctly.
POST: Always wanted White Teeth but never visited the dentist since I was 8 due to fear [gotten bad experience as a kid].        

So I heard that baking soda makes your teeth white if you brush your teeth with it.        
What I didn't get from all the reading, is that though it is supposed to be made into a paste, it shouldn't still be gritty.       

I always kept my baking soda paste gritty by putting very little water.        

After brushing straight with it for three months, my gum was extremely sore, but on the up side is, it is true, it is all true, I am amazed myself! My teeth is very VERY white now compared to the past and even when taking pictures, the teeth becomes the center of attention simply because of how white it is, even my friends jokingly asked if I have painted it white.       
These are the images after baking soda brushing for months, understand that I have NEVER visited a dentist ever since I was 8:    
   

As my ego grew, I forget about the irritation from the gum and keep on using it.      
One fine day, my gum gave up...I was brushing and I saw a nice chunk of my gum get physically brushed OUT of my teeth, I was shocked and at a lost of what I should do...I tried to piece the gum back in hoping that it would stay, suffices to say by the very next day, the gum eventually fall off.       

It is not that visible if I don't smile too big, but let this be a lesson to all of you out there, baking soda paste works, BUT PLEASE, make sure the paste is not gritty, PLEASE...don't experience this ever.

TITLE: Me [27M] with [27F] was she the one that got away?
POST: Basically this is just something that has been bugging me for a while and want to know what you guys think. I met this girl Cara when I was in college. We were both in long distance relationships throughout college so we never dated, but I flirted my dardnest with her.

Fast forward to graduation, I end up breaking up with my LDR and Cara moves about two hours away, gets engaged. I would talk to her semi-regularly during this time. 

Some time passes and she gets ready to move far away to grad school, I'm bummed by this, but she keeps saying she wants to see me before she leaves. We plan a night to go to dinner. She drives the two hours down to my house, we have an awesome night out, dinner, drinks. Go back to hang back at my house. I so desperately want to make a move, but the whole thing about her being engaged and not wanting to make things weird get in the way. We hug, say our good byes, and I figure that's the last time I'll see her maybe ever.

She texts me at 3 AM when she gets home and says she wants to hangout again. Now I'm really thrown through a loop.

She comes back down two days later, we go out for drinks again and we end up watching fireworks on a freaking boat. I was so god damn close to just kissing her but I didn't do it. And now she's married.

Did I fuck up? Was I just reading too much in to it? She was a pretty conservative girl (never saw her flirting with other guys). None of her friends really liked her BF and would sometimes insinuate that we would be better together. Not that any of this matters at this point.

When I get drunk I think about texting her asking if I should have made a move that night, but never actually do it.

TITLE: My dad's in the hospital, again. Need to vent a bit.
POST: My dad just turned 83 last week. The (sort of) short version of the chain of events is this. Last year he fell in the shower then didn't go to the doctor. For about the next 3 days he got weaker and more tired. He started hallucinating (seeing his dead brother in the room, etc.) so my mom got him to the hospital. He had lost a lot of blood through presumably some internal bleeding. They got more blood in him and stabilized so after a week he went home. He recovered pretty well.

Fast forward to October and one morning he couldn't get up off the couch, had no energy and was looking really bad, so back to the hospital he goes. He spent two weeks there this time (and had to miss my brother's wedding) because it was an infection in his blood and it took a while to get the right antibiotics in him to knock out the infection.

Three days ago my dad was back in the hospital again for being weak and hallucinating. Low on blood again so they've given him more, but he's still too weak to get out of bed, so we don't know how long he'll be there.

I'm starting to get really worried that he doesn't have much time left. He *just* retired about 3 months ago, and to think that now he could be near the end really sucks. He has lived to an older age than all of his siblings except one half-sister. I'm only 37 and I'm not ready to not have my dad around.

TITLE: Advice for dealing with a non-binding HOA and restrictive covenants.
POST: I posted this over in advice, but I only got one response, so I'm trying here...

A neighbor of mine received a letter in the mail today stating that the HOA was taking action against him for keeping chickens on his property.

The letter arrived normal post, and it described that keeping a chicken coop was against the neighborhood covenant and that he had been previously warned about the infraction.  It also stated that he would be responsible for the attorney fees and any and all legal fees associated with pursuing the case in court.

Being a non-binding HOA, I assume that they are only able to enforce the covenants outlined in the deed for the property which was created by the now-no-longer builder of the neighborhood 35ish years ago.   We've gone to the zoning department to view the original deed to the property and they said that the covenant was too old to enforce.

Here is the particular covenant that the HOA is referencing:
*No noxious or offensive activity shall be carried on upon any lot, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or may become an annoyance or nuisance to the neighborhood.  No hogs, goats, poultry, cows or horses which shall constitute a nuisance or cause unsanitary conditions, or any undesirable situation to any neighboring property, shall be maintained on any lot.*

Does anyone have any advice with how to proceed?

Can a covenant on a deed really be too old to enforce? 

How would you read ""which shall constitute a nuisance"" in the statement above?

We're looking in to getting an attorney but just ignoring them seems a might bit cheaper.

Some fun facts:

He has eight chickens, the coop is approximately 5' by 4' and 5' tall.  The run is about 20 feet square.

We live in the county so there is no ordinance against keeping small flocks of chickens.

Many other neighbors keep small flocks of chickens. (I keep chickens and bees.)

We do not pay dues to the HOA.

The attorney referenced in the latest letter lives in our neighborhood.
TL;DR: ",The non-binding HOA is threatening to bring one of my neighbors to court because he is keeping 8 chickens in his backyard.  The covenant that they are applying is old and vague. What should we do?,"Neighbor is being warned about chicken coop; he's had two warnings before and now he's gotten a letter stating that he'll be charged with legal fees and he can face court for violating a covenant in the deed.

TITLE: Why does my (24F) boyfriend (25M) of four months make these kinds of comments to me?
POST: I know we are all human here, and we all find people attractive. I'm happy to discuss beautiful people with my SO, but over the last few days a few comments just seem unnecessary. Why do you find it necessary to tell me that you like the way some reality show girl moved her mouth, (""Ooo, I like THAT."") Or, when discussing acceptable age differences in relationships, tell me that you would gladly fuck a 15 year old but not date her. This stuff feels hurtful but I cannot intellectualize why. It feels very sexually aggressive and almost disrespectful.

Is it unreasonable that this stuff makes me uncomfortable? We have been dating for about 4 months now, and I feel like this is just a sign of sloppiness. I reacted in the moment to his comment about that girls mouth, saying ""okay cool, I'll leave you to look at girls mouths and I'll head home."" and then he will cling to me saying ""no, don't go,"" kissing me, telling me he loves me..... I've also noticed an increase in the amount of ""play"" kissing (I don't know if other people do this, but it's just a playful kinda mouth thing...) versus actual kissing. I've been staying over his apartment (or he stays with me) most every night since we became monogamous. I'm wondering if this is all a sign that he is just comfortable and expects me to be there all the time. Maybe some distance would be good. I'm afraid though that he will interpret me spending less time with him as a decrease in affection, however...

Why do some dudes act like this? I am not sexually inhibited. I casually sexed a good deal while single, and I can recognize an attractive man. But I don't feel compelled to inform him in the way he seems compelled to inform me.

So I guess my main curiosities are: Is this a typical dude thing? Is it a sign of comfort level in the relationship? Is he being rude or am I just projecting my own insecurity?

POST: So my wife and I are adopting two kittens today and have been preparing the kitten room, cleaning thoroughly and setting everything up. Vacuuming was my job, and I was doing a damn good job (IMO). I should inform you that we have one of those Dyson Cyclone vacuums that has the cylinder that you detach and then press the button to empty from the bottom. So I detach the cylinder and hold it over the trash bag to empty. I press the button-dust, dirt and hair ALL OVER the floor while only a small amount made it into the bag. I curse silently, turn the vacuum back on and go to work. I had gotten most of it back into the vacuum when the garbage bag was caught by the vacuum and tipped over, spilling the rest of the vacuum's prior contents onto the floor. I cursed again (not silently this time) and cleaned the rest of it up. Such a simple task and yet, TIFU.

Woke up in the morning to a $150 fee added to my $40 phone bill. I called them and the guy I spoke to initially estimated 3-4gbs for a movie, but when I pointed out I had apparently used 7 he thought that was normal too. He straight away said he could get half of the bill knocked off, and I just agreed to that because I (clearly) am not very technologically informed. I guess I'm just frustrated that their automatic setting for going over your data is to charge you $70 a gb instead of just adding their $10 1gb data pack to your plan and then they can't even text me to let me know until I've already blown through $150 worth. I received 3 emails (even though they manage to text me about paying my bill) about four hours after I watched the movie saying I was 50%, 75% and 100% over my data limit, and then another few hours later finally got a text saying I'd used all my data.

Four days ago (4/16) she says that she thinks we should take a break so she can focus on school and work, but when she comes home for the summer (June) we'll be stronger.

I was recently hanging out with one of our mutual friends and she asked me how we were doing. I told her about our break and she decided to Facetime her. I stayed in the room and listened (instant regret)

My GF of almost one year (April 25th) was talking with passion in her voice about this dark skinned handsome boy genius who owns his own business at 21, and that she's spent the night at his house three different times. Our friend asked her if they did anything she responded with ""Not what you think but two other things."" My stomach sank and I just don't know how to handle this.

I'm going to call her when she gets off work in about an hour and confront her about it.
TL;DR: ","I live in OR she goes to college in Utah approaching one year and she wants to take a break, later find out she's been seeing another more distinguished man."," GF has been lying to me and telling me that our LDR is stronger than we are, how do I handle this?"

TITLE: I know this is going to sound selfish, but I'm going through a pretty rough time myself too, and I need to vent.
POST: I'm sorry that this is just another one of those tired old sob stories on AskReddit, but I think that I've reached a point that I can no longer keep this all in.  I'm a 26-year-old postgrad with a BA in Political Science from the University of Miami, and it's been incredibly hard to find employment.  I just want to do work locally; I've written to so many consulting firms and political groups over the past couple of weeks that my fingers have been starting to form calluses.  I may be unable to pay rent at the end of the month and I can't afford a plane ticket to Milwaukee to visit my family for Christmas.  I don't want to ask for their help because of the shame.

Getting a college degree was a huge accomplishment for me because of my intermittent problems with depression that never seem to end.  I've gone through the campus in the past to get psychological treatment, but because I am no longer a student /and/ I'm being dropped from my health insurance provider, I'm running out of the medication I need.  I tried so many different drugs in the past - I've been on Zoloft, Sinequan, and Abilify - now I'm taking, every day,.5mg to 1mg clonozepam as needed, 1.5mg bupropion (Wellbutrin) twice daily,.5mg uranium,.25mg viloxazine, and to top it all off, I'm getting back on Abilify.  I don't want to need to take the drugs, and I want to be productive with my life.  I just don't know where to turn to next.

TITLE: Me [24 M] interested in a university coursemate [22F] over the last 10 weeks, how do I ask her out?
POST: I'm a uni student, and every monday I take this particular 3 hour module. Now there's this girl in the course, which we shall call Mandy, who is very active in class. The particular course is a gender studies-related course, but her responses in class have set her apart from the other girls, because she does not give typical feminine responses, yet she has shown herself to be a very spunky person.

On the other hand, I'm also one of the more active contributors in class, as I'm one of the few guys in class, and I'm the one most likely to speak my mind, usually about controversial topics. And there have been times when we have been involved in arguments during the classroom.

Anyway, I've found myself interested in her around 3 weeks into the class, because I was very attracted by her personality and her brains. I also found out that she was actually from my year, and I've tried finding opportunities to talk to her before or after class. Usually we will sit in separate rows in class, because she would usually sit with her friend, and I would sit with my group of friends. But last week, I just went to sit beside her, and tried my best to seem natural about it. I don't think she minded, because as far as I could tell, she's not really close to any of the coursemates. In fact, every time I see her out of class, she's not interacting with others, even the people who were sitting beside her.

However, until now, I haven't had an opportunity to ask for her number, because I didn't want to scare her off. I wanted to add her on Facebook, but she doesn't have an account. The class is going to end in two weeks time, and I really want to grab this opportunity to at least ask her out before I possibly never see her again. Even if it doesn't work out romantically or anything like that, I would love to have her as a friend, because I think she's awesome that way, but I just don't know how to get closer to her. Please help!
TL;DR: ",How do I ask out a girl that I only see for 3 hours a week in class and that I don't know too well?,"Me interested in a university coursemate (girl in the course I'm in), what should I do to ask her out, or do I just need to wait it out?> "

TITLE: [23/f] American girl studying abroad just started a sexual relationship with a [25/m] Chinese boy.  Need advice!
POST: So, I am an American student studying Chinese language at a university in China.  I met a grad student here majoring in English and we really hit it off, right from the day we met.  I am a rather bold, outgoing girl who was raised in the New Jersey/New York area.  He is from a small rural area of China.  However, since he has been studying English language and American culture, we actually have quite a bit in common (like discussing politics, social issues, cultural differences, and Sino-American relations) we instantly connected.  I was actually surprised at how quickly things progressed.  I am only the second girl he's ever kissed, and the first girl to ""go all the way.""  Overall, we are happy with the no-strings-attached, mutually language-sharing/studying, and close friendship that we've developed.

Here's the problem: he is very self conscious, and tends to over-think during our romantic liaisons.  This can have some flaccid consequences.  I've tried to be as understanding, helpful, and supportive as possible.  I told him to think with his heart rather than his head when we have our trysts, but he has difficulty putting aside his worries and poor self-image.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation when seeing a Chinese boy?    Any advice is appreciated on how to teach him to let loose and enjoy himself without worrying about appearances or his lack of experience. I want him to enjoy himself as much as I do, and I want to make him happy.  Also, he has asked for this help, so my ""teaching"" is not unsolicited.

POST: I won't make this too long but basically at my job we all like to fuck with each other a lot. I have two co workers named Chris and Jeff who have pregnant girlfriends.

 We were on the conversation of sex and I said to Chris ""Ha you can't fuck your girl cause she's pregnant."" (yes I know you can still fuck your girlfriend if she's pregnant. It was a joke) 

Then I saw the other Jeff the same thing only this time Chris was behind me giving the hand-across-the-neck shut the fuck up signal but it was too late. He just looked at me heartbroken and said, ""She lost the baby."" And then walked away.

I didn't know what to say at that point so I just walked the opposite direction. Later on I went up to him and just told him how sorry I was and I had no idea. He assumed that everyone else had told me, but he wasn't too upset with me. It could have went a lot worse I guess.

Her and I met in class and have been talking for not too long a month or so. We have tons in common I have gotten her number and we text every now and then (more on that later.) But I have really I've made the most progress in the past week. So everything explained further takes place in a span of a week. 

I've hung out with her a few times. The times we have hung out have been good we seem to hit it off. She's kinda touchy and takes lots of pictures of us (bff on sc if that means anything.) She said things like I'm special for getting to see her act in her goofy way. She even made and brought me a sandwich for when we were studying together. But ever since then she seems less interested in me and we do not text as often. Which is weird cuz that was to me at least the time we hit it off the most.  Before We had been texting all day but now barely at all and remember this is all in a span of less than a week. 

Most recently we were supposed to hangout but she said she forgot (which is a big red flag I know) but we did reschedule for another specific day.

My boyfriend (M28) and I (F27) have been in a serious relationship for two years. Everything's been wonderful and I'm very happy. However, we're still not living together because he's ""not ready yet.""

There's really no reason why we can't live together. We both make great money, have little to no debt and our jobs are in the same area. But he says he's not ready.

He informed me last week that he's going to build a house and is going to look at land with a realtor next week. WTF!? He didn't discuss any of this with me or ask for any of my input. There's nothing wrong with the house he's living in right now. I don't understand.

TITLE: I [24M] tried to remain friends with ex-girlfriend [22F]. Her new boyfriend [21M] has insisted she stop talking to me.
POST: Broke up with my girlfriend earlier this year around February because we didn't feel like things were working out (1.5 years together). I was in a bad state and wasn't sure if I wanted to take the relationship any further. That said she is a fantastic person and I wanted to remain friends with her, so we have up until recently.

Around 2-3 months ago she stated getting serious with another guy and he hates the idea of her having anything to do with me. He insisted she stop talking to me, she said no at first and we met occasionally for coffee, talked on Facebook etc etc. He got really upset about it though and we agreed to scale things back a bit and only meet occasionally, every 2-3 weeks or so.

Recently I get a message from her saying ""She doesn't want to talk to you!"". After meeting with her again it turns out that he has been checking her phone and making her feel guilty about talking to me. He has also hijacked her phone and blocked me on Facebook/Snapchat several times and has done this for another male friend of hers too.

I realise that as the ex-boyfriend he may see me as a threat but this whole thing is really bumming me out. She is a great person and a great friend, I can't help but feel like this new guy is trying to control her life a bit too much.

I don't know what to do, I want to stay friends with her, but I can't so much as drop her a message without her new boyfriend having a melt down. I offered to talk with him to explain I mean no harm, but he refuses to talk to me.

TITLE: Parents will probably be against my[25f] relationship with my boyfriend[26M]
POST: My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for nearly 2 years and last year it turned into a long distance relationship. Meanwhile we have come to the conclusion, that we want to live in the same country and move in together.
My family expects me to get married in order to live with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I, we are both okay with that. 

The problem is, that my parents don't know about him yet. I have never told them because I was pretty sure, that they won't accept him for one specific reason.
And I am so sure, as I hear how they talk about other couples, that shouldn't be together in their opinion and in general am aware of their point of view on these matters. 

Actually there is a very small chance, that they might be okay with him because only his mother has a different cultural background and at the same time there is still a big chance, that they might be against him.

This means telling them about him will probably cause a conflict. The mood in the house will drop because of me, there will be disussions because of me, very dramatic and emotional discussions, everybody will be devestated because of me... All in all everything will feel dark and cold the following days. This scenario took place once in my lifetime because of a similar topic.

For this reason I am really afraid to tell them. But that is, what I want to do tomorrow or the day after. I really want to speak to them about him. What I am hoping for is to get some advice on how to handle this conversation, some motivational stories with happy endings, speeches about how I will regret not to tell and so on... I really need that right now :(

Some side notes:
I won't talk about marriage to my parents. That would be too much in the beginning:) I'll just mention, that I have a boyfriend and hope they'll accept it one day. Of course I will remain calm throughout the conversation. That is very important, I think.

My boyfriend knows about these issues and he understands me. I wanted him to know because otherwise it would not be fair to him. Luckily he has always been very patient.

Please. I have tried many times to understand why black people feel so entitled because of tragic acts that happened hundreds of years ago. (Since when were black people the only slaves?) Every SINGLE black man/woman I've met, has this particular attitude amongst them: Blacks need to ALWAYS stick together, every other race hates them, every other race is going out of their way to oppress them.  I see white people especially trying to embrace blacks and show them that they are equal, but then it is met by ""Oh you're just doing it to show you're not racist, but you are."" I turn on TV, blacks are in MANY commercials and ad campaigns that were created by whites. I see blacks in commercials and ad campaigns that were created by blacks, no whites there.

So We decided to meet for drinks on Friday, it just so happened to be my birthday too. I haven't been on a date like this in a while so I was nervous but I do well under pressure. I felt like it went well, but of course, I expect first dates to be a little shaky which is normal I think. I kept things light, I didn't talk about serious personal stuff and kept it short, about 2 hours. We left, walked her to her car, a little ""nice to meet you"" hug, and just your basic talk to you later kind of goodbye.  

This morning, asked her how she though it went and was told it was bad. Apparently it was some things I said. Of course, she didn't tell me what those things were and stopped texting me and unmatched me on Tinder. There's not much point in trying to remember all the things I said, but shit...I would like to know. I guess I'm just upset because she just slammed the door on me.

I haven't been out of the house but only five times (minus the chiropractor visits) in the past four weeks.I also start back to University on Monday and I have absolutely no clue how thats going to go down.

A while ago I got an email from a guy.  Long story short he claimed to be a part of a secret organization and is a master hacker.  He knew my class schedule and would give details about when I traveled where, and where he would watch me from.  He ripped pics from my facebook (which I keep private) and made creepy wallpapers with them.  He was using a fake name which had a few other webpages linked to them.  One of which was a foot fetish blog which he immediately deleted.  

He tells me I am so beautiful and that he loves me and dreams of me all the time. He called me his princess and claimed he loves me more than anyone ever could.  He said I was the only one for him and he would be my slave.    

Anyway, I suspect he is a teacher of mine and I straight up tell him so. (I'm pretty naive ok?) He then tells me all this stuff about his identity that is VERY similar to the person I suspect except for a few changed details.  He gives a TON of information about the teacher I suspect that he claims he got from the teachers 'file' by his expert hacking skills.  He gives me a name with the same initials that I cannot connect to anything (another fake name?).  

Suddenly he says he is leaving the country and hitching an illegal ride on a ship out of Seattle.  He claimed he could not live life seeing me be in love with someone else and that he hates everything about his life.  I really just wanted this guy to leave me alone so I am like, whatever.

Finally, he pretended to casually ""overhear"" something in our conversation, joined it for about one minute, exchanged cards with both of us, and left. I got a call from him an hour later. (Note: very attractive). We've been texting back and forth all day.

TITLE: Hey reddit, Have you been the cheater or ""cheated"" in a relationship?
POST: Just over a year ago I found out that my bf had cheated on me. I decided to stay with him (bad idea?) because I really do love him. However, I can't seem to let it go. I don't bring it up in fights or anything, but I do find myself getting upset over it every now and then. I have asked him why he did it, and the response I always get is, ""I don't know what I was thinking."" I was just wondering, as the cheater how does it make you feel if your SO won't let it go, and as the ""cheated"" do you still find yourself thinking about it or getting upset?

TITLE: 16M Having troubles with some insecurities, need some advice
POST: I'm on mobile at the moment so I can't tag, but I possibly can in the morning. 

I've been cheated on 3 times by 3 separate girlfriends in the past 10 months. Now I am over each one of them specifically, but it's developed some trust issues and I worry a lot now that I am in another relationship. Whenever I see my girlfriend talk to another guy (literally doesn't matter who) it bothers me, and I know there is almost no chance at all that attraction is there. I hate this, I wish it didn't bother me because I talk to other girls and it doesn't bother her. She's a competitive dancer and every once in awhile she goes on 5-6 day dance trips. I sit back in our hometown nervous as shit the entire duration wondering who's hitting on her or if anythings happening and I'll never know. I know these insecurities are stupid and I don't vocalize these things with her. 

She has a little experience dating but nothing serious, and I get the good vibes she wants this to be something that lasts and she cares about me, and I feel the same way. But these insecurities are killing me and I'd really like your guys advice on this. I really like her, and really don't want to get cheated on for a fourth time.

TITLE: My (20M) disinterest in sex is really hurting my girlfriend (19F) of 3 years
POST: My girlfriend and I started as a long distance relationship when we were in high school. We met three times over the years, each time for about a week, before moving in together during the beginning of this year. Initially, our sex life was pretty great. We had sex all the time and everything was fine. Lately, though, I've been wanting to less and less and it's really hurting her self esteem and making her feel like I'm unattracted to her. 

This may get a bit graphic, I just want to let you guys know why I'm not really that into it anymore in the hopes that you'll have some kind of advice as to what I can do. So generally, when we begin having sex, it's awesome. But after about a minute or so, it's like my dick goes numb. It makes it very difficult to stay into it, even though I enjoy pleasuring her. This makes me kind of dread having sex because I know it'll just end up being me trying everything I can do to make her feel good, while I'm just kind of there wishing it'd be over. Lately, we probably only have sex about once or twice a week, which is really messing with her self esteem issues. I feel awful everytime she tries to initiate it, because I just really don't want to and I know it'll end up making her feel awful. 

I have no idea what to do. I should probably just suck it up and do it for her. I've tried talking to her about it, but she takes it all so personally. Maybe it's just the way I phrase it. Are there any ways I can make myself more interested in having sex?

TITLE: Child Labor Laws: No break and 8-hour shifts.
POST: 16 year old, working at a fast food joint, around 21 hours a week for around the last 2 weeks. I live in Wyoming.

Not once, whether it be a 5 or 8 hour shift, have gotten a break. Several (3) people have told me this is highly illegal.

1. At my former job, a certain Taco supplier, was strict on getting a 30 minute break in (even if it was 15 minutes in my shift). My boss told me the state would charge 1,000$ to the restaurant if I did not receive a break.  In fact she used to work under the same boss a few years back, while pregnant. She claimed it was the exact same way. I always got a break at my former job.

2. My girlfriend's father, a former owner of 5-12 (certain fried chicken restaurants) also advised that it was illegal. I would assume he knows what he's saying, but he was running business in a separate state (Colorado)

3. Lastly, my government teacher told me it was illegal as well. He runs concession stands for high-school events. The topic came up when I said the 6 hours I spent today working in the stand was nothing compared to my normal conditions. 

If my boss is claiming to officials that I have received breaks when I have not, ever... how do I go about taking action against this. 

While I do want to quit, I also am curious if there is anything I could do in lieu of letting it continue. This isn't new for this business, they tend to have trouble keeping people. 

Also she printed off 2 copies of my SS card for ""just in case the printer can't read,"" it was in full color. I have no doubt she is malicious. Hoping she is too old and sweet to sell my identity.

TITLE: I [F/21] feel like I really don't care about most people and I want to change that
POST: I care about people in general, but when it comes down to individuals, I get so bored and annoyed with other people's lives. Most people don't genuinely care about how their cashier's day is going when they ask, but I feel like that about everybody, including my best friends. 

When my friends tell me stuff about their lives, it's all I can do to concentrate enough that I can respond appropriately. This makes me feel really narcissistic and just like a terrible friend in general, but I just can't bring myself to actually care about why somebody broke up with their SO or where they're going for spring break.

Since sharing stuff like that is a big part of friendship, I feel like I'm not actually friends with any of my friends. I've been sharing less and less with them too, as I wonder if my friends are thinking the same thing when I talk. The only person who I think I genuinely care about is my boyfriend. And now I'm worried that that care will fade and our relationship will end because of my apparent narcissism.

Facing them head on and letting the world know so the people in my life can help me grow. So I told those close to me and then I posted it publicly on Facebook. Surprisingly I received an alarming number of people who then did the same in return, they shared everything with me.

TITLE: I'll (24/M) will probably lose touch with my father (45/M) if we ever decide to move to separate places.
POST: So my relationship with my father is a strained one with a long history of arguments, hurt feelings, neglect and guilt.

Growing up lets just say he was a less than attentive father and I came to terms with it fairly quickly in life. My mother and father have been separated since I can remember and both were very young when they had me.

Without going in depth with my entire childhood we'll just say I never felt welcome and always felt like a huge burden in every sense to both of my parents. Living with my father it was especially hard when he chose his new wife and her daughters over me. Parties were attended, family photos were captured and trips to who-knows-where happened without me. Through this I learned independence and self-sufficiency where I kind of just accepted it and figured it wasn't worth my time to yearn for attention. However, Recently we've found a lull in or out bursts and have been really calm. Lately we've been trying to have conversations about whatever nonsense comes up and small talk here and there. For god sakes we teamed up the other day to change all four rotors on my car so that I could be done before nightfall. It's been an interesting last 10 months...

I'm completely able to be on my own and financially stable, but I just haven't decided to up and desert the man yet. Maybe its my ENTJ nature where I cut losses and move on but I can feel that my father and I will not have a strong enough bond after we move on to pretend to be related. 

I think I've accepted this already and it's a shame. Knowing that for years I'll probably forget about him and even worse is that maybe when I have grandkids that they'll probably never meet grandpa.

TITLE: I [27 M] have ""almost arguments"" with my wife [28 F] about cleanliness of things and related topics. Reddit, am I just a slob, or is she being unreasonable or (medically) OCD? Looking for opinions.
POST: So we've been married for quite a while, and get along famously on nearly everything. Except for one category, and that's the general sanitation level of things.

We both like to keep an orderly house, but specifically I mean things like sitting on a bed after having worn pants outside and sat down places. One time she acted like I was crazy for putting some jeans I had worn a few times (just out and about) back into a dresser drawer that I use for gym shorts and mostly clean things.

It's this among other things, with more examples I can give if necessary. The reason this bugs me from a relationships point of view is that while so far I've tried to just be glad that she's clean and tidy instead of falling to the other side of things and picking my battles elsewhere, this wears on me when through shock and surprise she kind of makes me feel like I was raised in a barn.

I am truly not sure whether I am in the wrong or is she on some of these things though. I don't possess the exact biological knowledge to say whether there's is reason or rhyme to this type of thing, but in general I just don't stress over the bottom of a piece of luggage that truly makes me wrong for putting it on the bed. I don't know. Or if it's normal to feel the need to run a bleach only cycle to ""clean out"" the washing machine after a load of soiled laundry went through previously.

TITLE: Me [21F] with [22M]. Can't tell if he's messing with me or just really weird/shy?
POST: I've had a crush on this guy from my gym for the past 2 years. Long story short, I found out he was interested in me back in May and we started texting.  

We always planned to meet at the gym at the same time. He actually seemed pretty shy because he would never say hi to me at the gym first. I'd always have to approach him first, but we'd have decent conversation, and he'd always hug me goodbye. We went on our first date after 2 weeks of texting & meeting up at the gym, and the date went really well, but he just stopped talking to me for no reason after this. He just ignored me at the gym and stopped responding to texts.    

Two weeks ago, we match on Tinder and I message him on there. He tells me to text him and we talk for like two days, then he disappears again.  

Two days ago, he randomly texted me and said ""I wanted to talk to you at the gym, but you're always talking to other people."" I asked him to just come up and talk to me, and he goes ""Idk why I do or don't do things. I'm weird and just really shy."" Then he send me a shirtless pic of himself.   

I saw him at the gym yesterday, we talked, and he gave me a hug before I left. I texted him today and he responded, but when I invited him to go out with me and my friends tonight, he just never replied. I don't get if he's just fucking with me or what.

TITLE: I [26 M] am uncomfortable with my girlfriend's [25F] Facebook pictures that include her ex. Is it fair ask her to take them down?
POST: To provide more color, I find it uncomfortable when I randomly click on my girlfriend's Facebook pictures, because her ex is in about half of them. What makes it extra weird is that I knew the guy/was kind of friends with him at one point in time while the two of them were dating. Additionally, the two of them were together for 5 years.

Admittedly, I am a pretty insecure dude, and when I see the pictures I imagine how they were together, and if she said the same things to him she said to me, if they did the same things together that we do, how their sex was, if their sex was better than ours, etc. So I suppose the pictures just trigger all of that. 

We don't have any recent pictures of each other on Facebook either. I am fine with this, and that doesn't need to change. However, the most recent pictures she has is of this person with whom she was with for 5 years. So with both of those things in conjunction with one another, it makes me feel weird and kind of sad. 

For the record, I always untag myself from pictures with any of my exes. I treat these pictures as my memories, my history, and in the past. Keeping the pictures on Facebook keeps the memories in the present.

TITLE: I [20s/f] ended a friendship. Now I'm going to have to be around my ex-friend [20s/m] and I don't know how to handle it.
POST: We were friends for a long time, and the friendship wasn't working for a lot of reasons. We were both at fault. I haven't seen him in quite a while, and now for reasons out of our control we're going to end up spending a fair amount of time together, probably for the foreseeable future. 

I'm worried that being polite and friendly might lead to us trying to be friends again, which I don't think would be a good idea for either of us. On the other hand, being obviously not friendly would cause a lot of drama (others would notice and ask questions, in addition to the general drama of being not-friendly to someone), and I don't think either of us wants that. 

Our friendship was really rocky and caused me a lot of emotional pain, and I've been very happy without that to worry about. Now I see myself being sucked back into that (for example, I'd like to not be posting this right now) and I don't want that to happen. 

I'd like to strike a balance between ""I want to be your friend again"" and ""I hate you"" and I suspect that that is going to be very difficult, especially since my feelings are still very mixed and he has been unwilling to communicate his feelings on the subject. Any suggestions, or am I just screwed?
TL;DR: ","I will have to see my ex-friend, don't want to accidentally restart friendship but can't give him the cold shoulder without causing drama. Help.","I ended a friendship with a friend, but I want to be friends, but I don't know how. Should I be cordial but not friendly to him? Or should I be outright hostile to him?"

TITLE: Have a job offer, but not sure if I should take it... Suggestions....?
POST: So, I've been unemployed for 3 months now.  I realize that this isn't that long, considering how long others have been out of work, but it's still a long time for me.

I quit my job 3 months ago, and because of it, I was denied unemployment.  I left voluntarily because I was told by the president of the wee little start-up that the company was folding.  I had a pending job offer for another company in another state, so I figured I was safe.

The job offer fell through, and what little savings we had left was used to get me back home to my family.

Time passed, and nothing has happened.  I'm submitting my resume everywhere, and even talking to temp agencies to get me working any job at all, even if it's a 50% paycut from what I was previously making.

About 2 weeks ago, I submitted an application for an ad before realizing that it was also out of state.  The ad was pretty much tailor made for my skillset, which was why I got all excited and didn't look at the location until after my resume was sent.

Well, today I got an offer for the job.  It'll be a slight paycut, but good money and possible growth potential.

Here's where I'm waffling.

One of the things I've also been working on is finding a new place to live.  The house we're renting now is utterly fabulous, but completely out of our budget range with me having absolutely no income whatsoever.  If I take this job, it's going to be out of state - with the pay, we MIGHT be able to make it, but my family will still have to find a cheaper place here in Oregon.  I have no money to get out there, the employer is not paying relocation.

I want this job - I need A job, and I don't want to turn a perfectly good offer down, considering it's the closest I've come and - as we all know - jobs are scarce and hard to find.

But....  I'm really not sure how I'll pull it off...
TL;DR: ","I'm out of work, got a job offer, but it's in another state, and I have no way to get there or a place to stay once I do.","I need a job offer, but don't know if I should take it."

TITLE: My [33 M] fiancee's [31 F] depression and weight gain are straining our relationship
POST: My fiancee has struggled in the past with episodes of depression accompanied by weight gain but has always managed to pull through, never really losing the weight but never gaining more than 2 to 5kg and always being focused on fitness and healthy living. 

I proposed to her a little over a year ago and in the period between our engagement and now, she has had extended periods of depression and gained I would estimate more than 25kg. That is to say that in the 4 years we've been together, she has gone from athletic to heavily built to what would now be clinical obesity. We are supposed to be married in less than 6 months. 

How do I communicate that her weight gain and extended depressive episodes are affecting everything from my attraction to her to my confidence in her ability to be a reliable mother and life partner? If she can't control her weight now with no stresses in life, what will happen when we have children?
TL;DR: <startoftext>","Over last year of engagement, fiancee's past issues with depression and weight gain have returned with a vengeance. Do I pull out?",

TITLE: How do I get/help my wife to femme it up a little?
POST: I love her and this is not, **repeat not**, a deal-breaker but I'd like her to be more feminine. She grew up basically feral, has no female relatives any less feral, and is too embarrassed to talk to her friends.
Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.
TL;DR: ","I'll brush her hair and keep her in nice scents, but anyone got any other ideas on how to feminize my wife a bit?","I love my wife but her lack of feminine style is starting to bug me. She's too embarrassed to tell anybody (I'm not telling her not to be), so I need some advice on what to do to make her want to do it."
