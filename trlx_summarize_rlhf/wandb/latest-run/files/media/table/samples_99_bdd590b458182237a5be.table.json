At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.\n\nSo, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.

I see most people as mindless animals that are just taking up space and fucking each other so that they can produce more mindless garbage. It just sickens me to see and hear what people do to others.\n\nI mean sure there are the people who actually go out of their way to make a difference and try their best to be good people but I feel like those people are so few and far apart. I believe that all people have the potential to be amazing, but I also believe that people have the potential to be horrible monsters, and I think that most people go in the bad direction.\n\nI don't know, maybe I am just some dumb high-schooler (17 years old in case you were wondering) who is too stupid to see that people aren't shitty. Maybe you people can show me the way. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to not hate people?\nTL;DR:", " I think most people are shitty and I think most people go in the wrong direction.

He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.\n\nIt sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me. This has happened at least 3 times already. Honestly I've lost excitement in going because I feel like it's never going to happen.\n\nI can't bring it up to him because whenever I do he gets really upset and apologizes a lot, which I appreciate, but I just would rather him say that he can't take me (if that's the case) rather than continue to drag this out.\n\nI feel bad for being upset, because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck. But it doesn't change the fact that he's been promising and not coming through, which is upsetting. \n\nI need an outsider's opinion so I can have some unbiased opinions to look through.\nTL;DR:", " My boyfriend hasn't gotten me anything yet, and I'm upset because he's promised and hasn't come through.

Lots of fresh veg, a bit of skinless chicken and some quiona, when I put the amount of food into MFP it tells me the calories are too low and I am putting my body into starvation mode, I am not sure I will be able to eat even half of this meal, but I am worried that if I don't eat more my body won't be able to repair itself.\nOn an average day I will eat about 1200 calories, consisting of porridge & honey for breakfast, lunch of a meat, veg and quinoa/couscous and dinner of fresh veg, meat and sometimes potatoes. \nI don't often find myself hungry and I drink about 2-3l of water a day, if I have less I get a massive headache from the central heating system. So I was wondering if anyone else finds MFP nagging at them to eat more calories. Even on the meals that I cheat with and have a pizza MFP is still telling me I am under my calorie limit although those days are the only days it doesn't nag me about starvation mode.\nTL;DR:", " I have been cooking healthier meals and working out almost daily for 25-35 mins of cardio, and recently started using MFP together.

That was a few years ago. I was in damn good shape. Could run, was thinking about joining the armed forces. Everything was awesome...\n\nA few years later, and I fell off. I turn 24 next week, and I was recently juuuuust over 300 pounds. I live almost exactly 100 miles north of New York City. Last semester IU started commuting to the city for work and school. I still live up north, because I have another job up there. Train tickets got expensive, so I saved money by biking instead of taking the subway.\n\nI only just started eating healthier a couple weeks ago, but I'm down about 10-15 pounds right now. Just hit 286, and I'm very happy. I know it isn't really progress, but it's nice to know that it's all improvement from here. I've done it before, and I can do it again. I know I won't let myself fall off.\n\nSo the first few times I took a bike a few miles from Grand Central Terminal to my job, only a few miles, I was so tired the next day. Mostly just my legs (Coat + Backpack didnt help >.<). Anyway, it has been getting easier, and I think now that it's warm I'll take up some weekend leisure rides. :)\n\nAlso, about 20 minutes ago, I took the elevator down to street level to go buy some food, and realized I forgot my wallet, which means I forgot my elevator key. I could have asked the door man, but instead just took the stairs 21 floors up. I was almost out of breath at the top, and I'm sure I will get muscle cramps tomorrow, but it was so worth it. :)\nTL;DR:", " I'm a 260 pound man, and I'm now a 290 pound man.
