We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.\n\nProblem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.\n\nWe decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. \n\nNow, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that.

This was at about 8:30 in the morning, and she was exercising. She turned the TV up extra loud to hear it over her excercycle, and woke me up. I went in there asking for her to turn it down. She said she didn't have to; I explained that I always used headphones so she didn't have to deal with my noise and that she should give me a little more respect, given that I paid rent at the time.\n\nShe disagreed. I went back to my room, rather pissed off at the lack of equality. I had no lock on my door; but I had a dresser right next to it, so I pulled one of the drawers out enough so that it caused the door to not be openable. Then, I turned my speakers up really loud and blasted Gangnam Style on repeat, with the bass cranked up as high as it could go.\n\nIf you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song. I personally don't mind it. But here's the thing about my bass; it vibrates the walls, making one hell of a lot of noise. Needless to say, my mom was not pleased and shut off the internet.

One problem being that I don't show enough affection. I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.\n\nFor Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.\n\nWe both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should.

There is no drinking fountain in the building, so I bring a giant 2L water bottle which I sip on all day to keep hydrated and counteract all the copious amounts of alcohol i drink (after work, of course).

Luckily the back door of my office opens up right near the bathroom, so I can usually drain the main vein without embarrassing myself by being frequently seen there.\n\nAs I was wrapping up work for the day, I realized I would have to pee one more time before leaving. It was slightly after 5, so when I walked to the bathroom, I wasn't expecting to see anyone in there (it is the kind of bathroom with a urinal and a stall).\n\nFuckup begins when I open the door and there is a dude who had just finished shitting and was leaving the stall. For whatever reason this terrified me for a split second and I jumped and gasped. \n\nThe guy was amused and chuckled and was like, did I scare you? I muttered something like \"haha, yeah, a little bit\" and I kept my head down, beelined to the urinal and unleashed the krakan. \n\nI was super embarrassed and very preoccupied so I didn't notice that the bottom part of my untucked, button-down shirt had slipped into my urine stream and was getting soaked.

So, to start off I am 16 years old and have started my second semester as a sophomore, in one of my new classes (team sports to be specific) I noticed a very attractive and genuinely cute girl. I have never been on dates or been romantically involved with any girls before, because I have social anxiety and I am pretty chunky and I have confidence problems because of it. Any way, back to the story, I notice this cute girl and I can't help myself and I stare at her then I gain focus and I am focused back on the game. The day continues normally until I look back and her eyes avert away from me quickly, like when you get caught staring at someone and you act like you weren't staring. So, I thought \"does she like ME?!?\" thought it might have been a coincidence but I caught her stare a few more times. So after we dress back into our normal clothes I stare at her and question. whether or not she could like a person like me. She caught my gaze this time and she turns away and talks to some dude. The dude was pretty weird but there wasn't a day when she wasn't talking to him during class. Anyway the dude gives me a dirty look and the bell rings and I thought maybe she doesn't like me maybe she was creeped out and told her possible boyfriend that I was staring at her all class. So yeah saw her walking away with the dude and I saw her eyes on me again and they avert again.

But we would always get along, eventually.\n\nIn the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say \"no\", as always, without looking me in the eye.\n\nAnd now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done.
