At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.\n\nSo, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.

My family and I chalked it up to being in a new environment since we brought him to stay with us overnight at my grandparents' new home. This wasn't too worrying to us, since Miles is epileptic (relatively common among beagles) and we assumed he was having a mild seizure. But the problem persisted through the night and every couple hours he would start shaking again on every inhale. Also, he refuses to jump onto the furniture he knows he's allowed on; he chooses to stay on the floor and whine or I have to pick him up to be on the furniture with me. What I noticed starting yesterday is that he seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches. I tried lightly poking him in those areas every couple of hours and every time I do, he yelps. \n\nThroughout all of this I noticed what worries me the most. As any beagle owner would know, beagles can't shut up around food. Never before has Miles acted calm around food, let alone slept in his kennel during Easter lunch in a strange environment. He won't run up to snatch a treat out of my hand, either. I have to offer it to him a few inches from his nose, or, if I throw it on the floor he might be bothered to mosey on over and chomp it up very slowly. \n\nDoes anyone know what may be wrong with him?\nTL;DR:", " My beagle is acting weirdly and I'm worried he's sick.

Sorry about the text wall. Located in the United States.\n\nA few months ago, I bid on (and won) an auction for tools and other supplies on a popular online auction website. The package was mysteriously delayed during shipping at one of USPS's sort facilities due to what I assumed was the rather extreme inclement weather.\n\nOnce I received the package, I found a letter from the postal service INSIDE the box stating that due to a mishap at the facility there were packages that became dislodged during shipping. If any problems arose to send a letter to their complaint department. The package did not contain the tools but rather an incredibly large number of sealed DVD sets to a very popular TV show. \n\nI contacted the seller and he had no idea what I was talking about with DVDs. He stated that he sent only the items pictured in the auction. I have no reason to believe that he was being disingenuous because when you compare the price of both items on Amazon, the overall value of the DVD sets is much, much higher.\n\nAfter some back and forth with the USPS I was able to reach someone who started an official search at the three USPS sort facilities in the region. After three months they terminated the search and stated that my item was not found. I also inquired what to do with the DVDs that I received. Initially they said to keep them sealed because if my original package was found, they may need me to send the DVDs back to the sort facility. But later they essentially told me on the phone that they didn't know what to do with the DVDs.\n\nMonths have gone by, and I decided to try and recoup my money so I've started selling them locally. I've only sold a handful, but I began to wonder what kind of legal ramifications I could run into?

Given that reaching under my dress to the purse would involve flashing my underwear to a shop of Spaniards, I decided that the most decent option was to plunge my hand down the top my dress, rummage for a while finding the zip on the passport holder, extracting the note and closing the zip, then to slowly remove my hand holding the 50 euro note without accidentally pulling up the dress.

For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.

Let me summarise:\n\nI was in a relationship for 8 years, half of that living together, which seemed to go very nicely as we were even organising our wedding just before the break up. But important changes in life (mainly me moving to another country for a new job) ended up revealing some insecurities, lies, and finally ending the relationship due to lack of willing to go forward by my ex-partner.\n\nThis happened 6 months ago, and even if at the start it was very hard, suddenly living alone in a different country when months ago I was planning a wedding and considering having kids, I was lucky as I joined a very nice group of people at work and my old friends even if far away have helped a lot.\n\nAfter the first months of missing my ex, it transitioned to just missing being with someone, and then I was able to just focus on myself, enjoying life and improving both my body and mind.\n\nAnd then... I started considering looking for women and dating. The problem is that I'm not really sure that I'm really prepared for a new relationship, or if I'm looking at it because I feel alone. This was my only serious relationship, so this is unexplored territory for me. Thinking cold about it, I kinda believe that I should wait until I don't feel the need to not be alone (6 months after 8 years is not that much after all). But at the same time I think that this relationship has showed me how much a family guy I am and that I really want to share my life with someone.

How will this help my tax returns?\nPOST: This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. \n\nA little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied.

We're moving in together (platonic) in a few weeks in a new city and we're both extremely excited, but I'm nervous about our relationship.\n\nPeople tease us already that we're dating and his mom is convinced that we're together. We usually just deny it and laugh it off, but I feel like there's some subtext that we're not addressing. We'll playfully tease each other or he'll tickle me randomly when we're hanging out; we're pretty touchy/cuddly with each other but nothing over the top or scandalous. We talk about everything and I feel it's safe to say we're best friends. \n\nThere have been moments where I've wanted to kiss him and be relationship cuddly, but there's always been something holding me back. Like, I can't picture having sex with him at all (not that he's unattractive, I just literally can't see it). I want/can picture kissing him, but the second I try and imagine something more sexual, I can't.  \n\nFuthermore, I can't say I'm too thrilled about him getting a girlfriend either. It's not like I'd ever sabotage anything for him, but I'm not too keen on the idea of sharing him or spending less time with him. I know that mindset is unhealthy, so I'm trying my best to keep it under wraps. \n\nI'm afraid I'm in an emotional relationship with him and I'm concerned about what might happen when we move in together.

For years I struggled with paying bills, sometimes because of low income but just as often because I was disorganized. After making simple changes to my bank account structures I don't miss bills, have lowered my spending and can understand my expenses better.\n\nThe trick is pretty simple. Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses. Then go about setting them all on auto-pay. Most of the time you can connect the bank numbers or use a debit card to automate payment. If you need to pay an individual or have to pay by check most banks have a bill pay feature that will send scheduled payments by check.\n\nAt first you'll need to overpay into this account because your expenses estimate might be off and you need a buffered balance. After a couple of months you'll be able to pay in almost exactly what you need. Then you can setup automatic deposit to cover all your expenses.\n\nCongratulations, your financial life is now completely automated. Did you remember to pay such and such bill? Yeah totally. Analyzing your accounts it looks like you're paying for a lot of online storage. Google sells space cheap. Consolidate accounts and save. Get hit with an unexpected bill? There's plenty of buffer in the account, just pay a bit more in to make up and move on.\n\nIt can take a while to move all your accounts over, but once you do the benefits of organization are massive. Also, once you make that one or two payments into the account per month (pay into it right when you get income) whatever remains is your spending / saving money.\nTL;DR:", " Set up a bank account for all your recurring expenses.

I'm going to allow myself to keep falling in love with him (because honestly I couldn't stop myself if I tried) and I'm going to stay just as faithful as I've been this entire time, *but I'm not trusting him for shit*. Fuck that.\n\nI already know what's coming. I've probably been getting played since the beginning, and I'm definitely being played now. I'd be a fucking idiot to think this guy actually loves me.\u00a0\n\nI mean really, why did I think I was special? What made me think I was so special that he would want to be with me exclusively? I only believed it because that's what I wanted, but what the fuck? Could I be a bigger fucking idiot? Damn.\n\nI'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. Sooner or later it'll get more obvious that I'm being used and I'll be discarded, or the betraying will become apparent. Whatever comes first. So at least for now I can love him without being fully aware of how I'm being fucked.\n\nIt'll actually be cool to get my heart broken because then I can really numb out. Any faith I have in people would be sucked out and replaced with cold detachment. I'll shut people out of my heart in the name of defense. If I don't trust anyone to begin with, then they would have no chance to fuck me over. Awesome.\nTL;DR:", " I'm an idiot for getting myself into this. I'm an idiot for trusting him.

We had spoken before about this account a few months into our relationship and agreed that as long as it wasnt being used there was no reason to deactivate it. \n\nA year later i logged into mine to  look at a friends potential date, and saw he was online. I went back the next day and there he was again. Over the next few weeks i checked in daily and he was online up to 3 times a day. I mentioned I saw him on there and he lied to me, saying it was once off answering a friend. He got angry that I brought it up and accused me of being paranoid and untrusting, and that he would have to shut it down because of my issues and i securities.\n I havent told him yet that I know he lied, Im trying to come to terms with his response and not blow up. I genuinly dont believe he is cheating on me, but the fact he is browsing other women, and choosing to lie to me and put me down instead of admit it is a huge red flag, and not in line with the love he claims to have for me. I feel disrespected and upset that my relationship is not based on honesty like I thought. I have just left a job to move across the country to be with him, and now Im unsure about my decision. He knows honesty is non negotiable with me, this has seriously damaged my idea of our relationship.\nAny advise or insights?\n*Ive never been insecure or untrusting in relationships.

She is very attached to me. How can I let her down easy?\nPOST: I've been seeing a girl over the summer. Shes really sweet but has been giving hints she wants to make our relationship official.  I've given it some thought and I decided I don't want to take it to that level with her.  Like I said, she is really nice, but we're in different places in life and I just have a gut feeling that I don't want to take it any further.  She has gotten really attached to me though and I know this is going to crush her.  She also lost one of her parents recently which makes the whole situation worse.  I've been in a shitty place too so we've been really helping each other emotionally.  So some part of me really doesn't want to do this since I'll be more emotionally isolated, as well as her.  I would love to keep things casual, but I don't think that would be healthy for her since I'm afraid she would say yes with the hope I would change my mind.\n\nHow can I let her down easy, or as much as possible given the situation?

Before moving in with me he knew I was gay. However in February he told me that he became very religious (joined Knights of Columbus) and could no longer live with me. He asked me to 'control myself' until November at lease end or he would have to move out. \n\nI never had anyone over while he was at the residence and you would never know I was gay unless I told you. This all started because I had a straight friend over and the entire time he 'freaked out' thinking of what I might be doing with him. I was so furious at the time I told him to just move out.\n\nHe moved out, I could not find another roommate so we were forced to give notice to the leasing office we would be leaving. He continued to pay bills, rent, etc. \n\nHere is my problem, there is a $1000 dollar cancellation fee, he is to pay half and I have to pay half. I think it's ridiculous though because he is the one that broke the lease contract on his own accord based on his views, I did not want too. My attorney says the same and says the state will agree with me in small claims court. He sent my roommate a letter stating that he must pay or we will pursue civil law suit action. However no results. \n\nMy attorney is suggesting I send him a letter basically saying 'If you are a true Catholic as you say then you will pay him the money because it's the right thing to do. He suggested I quote some excerpts from the bible. I'm not religious so I'm not too versed on what excerpts I could pull out. \n\nI would appreciated any help you guys could give me!\nTL;DR:", " My ex-roommate is a Catholic and is refusing to pay the $1000 cancellation fee.
