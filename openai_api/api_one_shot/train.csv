TITLE: I (f/22) have to figure out if I want to still know these girls or not and would hate to sound insulting
POST: Not sure if this belongs here but it's worth a try. 

Backstory:
When I (f/22) went through my first real breakup 2 years ago because he needed space after a year of dating roand  it effected me more than I thought. It was a horrible time in my life due to living with my mother and finally having the chance to cut her out of my life. I can admit because of it was an emotional wreck and this guy was stable and didn't know how to deal with me. We ended by him avoiding for a month or so after going to a festival with my friends. When I think back I wish he just ended. So after he ended it added my depression I suffered but my friends helped me through it and I got rid of everything from him along with cutting contact. 

Now: Its been almost 3 years now and I've gotten better after counselling and mild anti depressants. My mother has been out of my life since then so there's been alot of progress. Being stronger after learning some lessons there been more insight about that time of my life but when I see him or a picture everything comes back. The emotions and memories bring me back down. 

His friends (both girls) are on my facebook because we get along well which is hard to find and I know they'll always have his back. But seeing him in a picture or talking to him at a convention having a conversation is tough. Crying confront of my current boyfriend is something I want to avoid. 

So I've been thinking that I have to cut contact with these girls because it's time to move on because it's healthier. It's best to avoid him as well. But will they be insulted? Will they accept it? Is there going to be awkwardness? I'm not sure if it's the right to do and could use some outside opinions.

POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

TITLE: Me [19F] with my friend [19M] 10 months, Insecurities - Show or Tell?
POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!

TITLE: Prioritize student debt or saving for down payment?
POST: I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. 

Sometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. 

At the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment? I have $5200/mo to somehow split between debt and down payment and I'm not sure how best to allocate it.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.

TITLE: Me 28 F with guy I'm dating 30 M - 1 month, Is it okay to ask if everything is okay or am I being pushy?
POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

POST: The other day my girlfriend(23 years old) and myself(22 years old) were talking and she revealed to me that she almost didn't date me because I was too short (5'7""-5'8"").  She is only about 5'5"".  Now she loves me a lot and thinks I am the best thing to ever happen to her but for some reason, learning about this, really turned me off. I have never associated height with anything other than how tall is someone, but apparently people associate height with strength, power, attractiveness and other stuff that has nothing to do with height.  Is it bad of me to want to break up with her for this shallow view?

TITLE: I (27/F) am obnoxiously paranoid after a gynecological health scare. How do I explain my ridiculous hormonal-ness to my boyfriend (32/M)? (X-posted to /r/AskWomen)
POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.

When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.

It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?

TITLE: Me [20/F] having trouble with boyfriend [23/m] of 2.5 years sex drive
POST: My boyfriend and I have an amazing sex life. We are very sexually compatible.

Although, his sex drive is crazy high compared to mine. It really depends on the time of month for me [hormones], sometimes I'll be down to go 3 times a day and sometimes I'm only interested in once a week. 

I'm asking for advice because I have a hard time denying him without him feeling rejected by me. For example, every time we cuddle he is almost always coming on to me. At night he comes on to me, in the middle of the night he masturbates next to me, and tries to come onto me in the morning. I'm utterly flattered that after being in a relationship this long he is still very turned on by me, but sometimes it is very overwhelming to keep up with his sexual needs. 

I've been trying more to just give him a HJ or BJ if he is really frisky and I'm not, but sometimes I really am just emotionally drained from life and just want to be cuddled. I've explained this to him several times and he gets very frustrated and defensive and states he doesn't feel like I want to please him....which is not the case at all. I can see how sometimes he would feel this way because when he asks sometimes my ""tone"" may come across annoyed or uninterested. I don't want him to feel this way and it has been a problem for a while now. 
I want to learn how to approach his needs better without him feeling rejected, and I want us both to be happy.

I have talked to a couple of friends about this and they have all told me that if I'm not ready to move out then I shouldn't, but I have lived a very abusive life here at my house so moving is for the best.

TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

TITLE: Me [ 20/F] with my bf [ 20/M] of 3 years. I've found myself attracted to someone else. Need advice on how to overcome.
POST: So I have been in what I consider a serious relationship for a few years now. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs, but things have been great these past few months. I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. 

And I know my usual advise for someone in this situation would be to cut out the distraction entirely, but since we work together I can't. I usually tell my boyfriend everything, but this I don't want to, I don't want to hurt him, and in addition I'm afraid of building it up into something more than it is. But when I'm upset with my boyfriend or feel like he's ignoring me I find myself thinking about this other man. And I feel awful for doing so. Sorry about all the text, I guess my question is: have you ever been in a situation like this before? And how did you overcome it?

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

I live with 3 other dogs: a 10 year old labrador, a 2 year old French Bulldog and a 8 year old maltese mix. The four of them get along just fine, Rome and the Frenchie are best best best best friends.

 

He isn't the best at meeting new people, but not ALWAYS. Sometimes he gets skittish, circles with his tail between his legs. Other times he happily brings the new person a toy and wags and is generally adorable. I've found that if I'm around and make a big happy ""look at your new friend! Now go find a present! What a good present and what a good dog!"" noise he gets happy and excited. We've been having massive construction on our house for the last 7 months and now he's best friends with all of the workers, walks around the yard helping them, and they've learned all of his commands from me (sit, down, wait, paw, other paw, and touch- a favorite). 

 

Dogs are a little trickier. I have a big yard and people are always wanting to come over for doggie playdates. I don't know if on-leash is the best way to first introduce, or let the new dog into the yard first and then bring my dog (his name is Rome) in on a leash, or meet in the street or what. There is always a little getting-to-know-you period and then play (if sometimes a little intense). If the new dog stays too long, a fight usually breaks out. He never starts the fight but he always stops it. He's not seriously hurt anyone, yet. But I feel like its just around the corner

 

Then, the crux of the matter: I want to have a 4th of July party. Several people want to bring their dogs. I doubt I can say ""no dogs allowed"" and I don't want to let everyone else bring their dog and make mine stay at day care all day.

It was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn't realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I'd realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn't have any classes left).

I ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She's really fucked. Nah, don't worry about it, she'll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can't tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can't remember the rest of the conversation, so I don't really know what else was said.

TITLE: Has anyone ever gone batshit crazy before, and how did you patch your life back after that?
POST: *First time posting on Reddit. Been lurking for awhile and thought this a much merry place to be.*

For context, I have been suffering from depression for the last few years. And as a reaction to depression, I did get pretty angry for awhile, and lashed out at people close to me. I'll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. 

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

Anyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.

Plus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.

But I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me. 

Plus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.

I've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. 

My question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.

Thank you in advance, Reddit.

TITLE: Contacting my biological father, who doesnt know I exist because of falsified DNA test [Washington]
POST: I'm going to try to keep this short so it doesn't drag long into a soap opera.

When my Mom [22 F at the time] got pregnant with her boyfriend at the time [24 M], aka my Dad, she decided he would be the right fit for many reasons. He ended up harassing her by constantly calling her work/showing up at her house. My mom ended up getting a retraining order.

Fast forward to when I was born, my Dad wanted to get custody over me which my mom did not want. I ended up being sent to a different country as a baby during the whole trial. When the court asked for the DNA test, not sure how they did this, my mom used a different kid for the test? So it ended up being in court that he is not my father.

Now growing up I didn't know anything about the DNA testing, but I knew about the harassment and being sent to a different country. (I was sent back to my mom around the age of 1 once the case was done). My mom was honest in terms of that her and my Dad didn't work but I could meet him when I turned 18. She said it couldn't be before then or else he might try to get custody over me. Once I turned 18 she ended up telling me about the whole DNA thing, and how she feels horrible but is asking me to not meet my Dad as he might press charges against her if he found out that what she did was illegal.

Now currently I'm 19 and am 100% sure I found the other side of my family through investigation. But now am unsure how I should even approach him? My mom has been abroad for the past 2 years and my relationship with her has gone down the drain, for other serious reasons.

In the end I'm just kind of lost at what I should do as I want to meet my Dad I never knew. And my whole life we've lived in the same town. And he lives only 10 minutes from my place. What should I do? Thoughts and opinions?

POST: So basically I met a girl in the beginning of the semester during our orientation week.  She caught my eye the first day and we ended up talking on a bus ride somewhere and clicked.  We exchanged numbers and continued talking.  

Fast forward a weekend and I actually start texting her (during orientation week we were in the same group so saw each other everyday) and have quite a long conversation.  We continue texting and I eventually ask her to hangout (eat) which she agrees to.  We go to an ice cream shop and me being a dumbass forget to pay for her, but she didn't seem to mind.  We talk for a good 3 hours, losing track of time, and then I dropped her off back at her dorm and there was that.

I text her at least once a week and we have lunch together at least once a week for the last six weeks.   

We have different majors so the only time I see her is when she is walking to her class (small school) and our weekly lunch. Though I ask her if she wants to do something almost every weekend but since she is a is a D1 athlete so she doesn't really have a lot of time on the weekends due to that and homework. Either way I still ask just because.

Overall, I really like her and I feel that through our conversations she does the same. I've been told that because of our lunch deals and me taking her out twice we're basically together, but I want to know for sure.  

Oh and I haven't been in a relationship or had a thing with someone before and she doesn't know this.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

TITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend's [22M] Dad's side of the family.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

I just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?

TITLE: I [28 F] just confronted my Borderline mother [54 F] about all the things she has done to ruin my life up until now...
POST: I had been advised by my psychologist not to contact her due to the negative effect she was having on my personal life and mental health (I myself have problems with mental illness). But she had been relentlessly trying to contact me after I cut off contact without giving her a reason. 

So today I emailed her detailing everything she had done including the emotional neglect and abuse of myself and other family members and of her interfering and trying to end the relationship between myself and my husband on numerous occasions, and of ignoring my mental illness and making me suffer it out for years as a child, plus multiple other things I can go into if requested.

The thing is now I can't help but feel guilty despite everyone patting me on the back and me knowing it was needed for closure. She has conditioned me to feel extreme guilt if I go against her wishes etc.

As many people with Borderline parents know, the parents sometimes don't realise they have a problem despite the diagnosis of a mental illness (she thinks it's everyone else who is crazy, not her). So I know she will deny everything I have told her, yet she will play the victim as usual and somehow it will get back to me and I will again feel terribly guilty.

Anyway I am just wondering if anyone has experience with borderline parents or other relationships and how they coped with the guilt of confronting the person, or how they coped at all with the stress of the situation. I'm in a rush so I'm sorry if I've left heaps out, I'm new to reddit as well so getting used to the layout, but I can add more details if requested.

TITLE: [Update] I [17 M] am crazy about this this girl [17 F] and need advice on how to proceed.
POST: My previous post can be seen here: 

We have remained in touch since I originally posted this. She has since broken up with this guy [17/18 M] from Alberta, apparently due to what I understand is the relationship being somewhat abusive in nature. We met again on Friday and I thoroughly enjoyed the encounter of ours. I'm kinda crossing over into r/depression territory here, but I think that one of the reasons that we've seemed to bond is that we are both suffering from varying degrees of depression.

Before I reconnected with her in September (after previously having met her earlier in the year) my depression was reaching what I consider to be an all time high. I felt like I was completely alone and had to fake any happiness that I presented to my friends. I made a lengthy post on FB basically ranting about this and she messaged me a short time later. She told me that I didn't have to worry and that I could always come to her for help/advice. I thought that this was awesome, especially considering that nobody had really showed me this sort of of attention prior to my post.

This would eventually lead to the meeting/date at Tim Horton's which I mentioned in my previous post. It was there that we had an open discussion about both of our depressions. It had a great time and she was the first person that I was able to talk to in detail about this. Our second meeting on Friday was just as good, if not better, than the first. We had more open discussions about various things that we were going through/had gone through.

I thought my situation was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to what she had gone through. I won't go into detail but suffice to say she gained a lot more of my respect that day. I can also honestly say that me being with her was the first time that I felt legitimately happy in such a long while. I'm really looking forward to us meeting again.

So now that this other guy from Alberta is out of the picture I'm wondering what exactly I should do. I would like to ask her out for a formal date but I'm not sure how long I should wait considering she was just in a relationship.

TITLE: I [28m] am afraid to commit to a girl [26f] I really like because of my lack of relationship/dating experience. And the fact that she is ugly.
POST: I have been dating this girl for a few months now and I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. At first I did not really see this as anything long term, but gradually I have started to appreciate every little thing about her. I have started to picture us together in the future, travelling together, starting a family. 

The problem is that I've spent most of my life working my ass off and have not really had much time for dating or relationships.  I'm close to finishing my PhD and I always imagined myself spending some time after that dating and finding out what I want. But now I suddenly find myself in this relationship that I can see potentially lasting forever. 

I think about this a lot, for example after after a recent conversation where she was telling me about some of the awkward dates she had in the past, because I know 
that it also helped her figure out what she wants and to realize that I'm the right one for her. A part of me wants the same experience. I am afraid that I will always be looking back and regretting not to have tried anything else. 

Confession: While writing this, I finally had to admit to myself the biggest reason for my hesitation. It was difficult to face it, but I have to be honest. If my girlfriend was perfect there would be no problem, but in the looks department, she is a 5, while I am a 9. I don't want more dating experience just to make sure that my current girlfriend is perfect for me, but also to convince myself that a ""traditionally"" prettier girl would not make me any happier. Because the fact is that I know that my girlfriend would make me happy, and that I can make her happy. 

I know that I can't just tell her that I love her, but that I need a few months on my own to find out what I want... 

Are there any solutions to this problem? I realize the obvious answer is ""you just don't want to be with her, end this"", but that simply isn't true.

TITLE: My [23M] GF [22F] is a bit too active on my Instagram for my comfort level.
POST: We've been together a few months now and things are going swell. We're some 150 miles apart (she works, I'm in grad school). We see each other every or every other weekend depending on how busy we are and it's good so far.

One small hiccup: our presence on social media. By nature I'm a pretty private person and keep a small group of friends. I only share relevant stuff with my close friends and I am not prone to advertise my life, I think its a bit frivolous. Yes I have a Facebook, Twitter, and IG but I use that to keep a tab on what's going on in the world but just so I'm aware and in the loop. 

She's a bit of the opposite.

We've recently become followers of each other on Instagram (IG is shorter for my convenience) and we both have browsed through each other's IG's to look at old pics as I'm sure everyone does. Little comments here and there, the usual.

BUT this is where my problem begins. I have some family/friends on IG but as I said, not everyone I care to advertise my relationship(s) to in general because it's called a personal life. Some of her comments are pretty G/PG but quite a number are saucy and flirtatious (PG13/R). I'd rather she not post such things on my IG but I don' t know how to tell her without sounding like an asshole. I've begun to field questions from people I don't care enough to share about my personal life and it's kinda annoying to be honest.

What's the best way to tread this delicately but not come across as an asshole?

I got really loose on the first date and may or may not have said that i'm not looking for anything serious. We went out on brunch and other stuff afterwards and sex just happened along the way. i have been going out on dates since then with other people but never went so far as sex. 

Until very recently, we see each other on average once a month and sometimes we just hang out. I have never slept over at his place before last night (i am a light sleeper and the idea of sleepover stressed me out) although he stayed at mine 2 out of the last three times he came over. 

Another thing is frequency, he came over ""prepared"" (brushed his teeth, packed suit for next day) this thursday after i booty texted him while drunk. Then he wanted to see me on friday, which i turned down and on saturday again - to which i responded and went to stay at his place because my heater is broken. 

We never define what it is, fuck buddies or fwb. Now that sleepover seems more regular, i don't know if it's time to bring up the question. If so, how should i communicate this? As far as myself is concerned, I am willing to go down the casual dating route and be perfectly happy about it.

TITLE: Me [23 F], my SO [24 M] of a year, I want to break up but I have no place to go.
POST: So I have been dating my boyfriend over a year. Let's call him Austin. I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met. I worked through a terrible depression which has been persistent for the past few years. I isolated myself so now I am friendless, jobless and have no transportation. I am trying to put my life back together and after long reflection, I have realized Austin and I are two very different people. There is a general lack of communication and respect for the other person. So here is my dilemma: Do I  break up with Austin?

 I am a very open, honest person. It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together. I have an older sister across the country but we have not talked in years. The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. 

My older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.

 It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on. But I also took a vow never to subject myself to my parents abuse again. I am open to any other ideas/suggestions/solutions.

POST: ""Estranged"" isn't really the right word though. We have never had a relationship of any kind. We have hated each other since the moment she was born. Not once in the past decade (despite living together and going to the same school) have we even spoken to each other without it turning violent, or at least becoming a screaming argument. 

I moved away from home to go to college in one of the most stressful engineering programs in the country--it was like entering a peaceful zen trance. I felt safe sleeping without a lock on my bedroom door, I stopped grinding my teeth, and I stopped getting stress headaches.

However, my mom is very close to both of her siblings and considers it *very* important to have those relationships. She is completely convinced that now that my sister and I are ""adults"" we will suddenly get along. Now, at least half of the visits I make to see my mom, my sister will ""accidentally"" be coming to visit at the same time. It's gotten to the point that I dread going to visit my mom (and often just skip it completely), because my sister might be there. Seeing my sister makes me so angry and unhappy that I feel sick to my stomach, and it ruins the little time I have with my mom (I live in another city and have a very time-intensive job).

What can I do to convince my mom that tricking us into a room together is just making things worse? Has anyone ever heard of someone else going through this? Everyone who I have ever talked to about it (parents, friends, etc.) dismisses it--""it's a phase"" or ""everyone fights with their siblings"" and no one seems to believe me when I say that something is horribly wrong.

The only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn't sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn't a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He's not a dick, he's my best friend"". 

Next day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". 

The thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do.

I [19f] have started a new summer job and will be transferring to a university that 4 hours away. I will be quiting exactly a month from now. I met this [21m] guy at my job. He's great and we are both interested in each other. Next time I see him at work will be Saturday and his close friend told me that he is planning to ask me out. I have never had a crush like this before and this is also the first guy who is interested in me in a non-sexual context. My only issue is that he isn't in school and therefore lives permanently up by our job. I am moving into an apartment by my university and will be living down there until I graduate in 3 years (I will be an entering sophmore). I see myself as having 3 options:

TITLE: I [27 M] met an amazing girl [29 F], but my superficial prejudices could screw it up.
POST: I went on an online date with an amazing girl. She's smart, funny, and we just had chemistry. I've been on many online dates, and the awkward silence during certain bits of the date is just par for the course. This date was different. We always had something to talk about, and more over we were on the same page. We'd even say the same thing at the same time - it was surreal.

This girl is also beautiful. She was a bit heavier than her pictures, but this is something I've come to expect from online dating, and I didn't really mind.

Date 2 was great too. More of that awesome chemistry, more of that great conversation. Then the clothes started coming off, and I don't know why, but she was just a lot heavier than I thought under the clothes. I don't know if she was much bigger than I thought, but her bodyfat ratio was high, and she didn't wear the fat well.

I am very attracted to her when she's clothed, but I have to admit I became less attracted after she got naked. I hate that I even have to say it because our chemistry is so perfect, and she has a very pretty face even.

So now I'm in conflict. I am thinking I want to hang out with her at least one more time to see if I can get over this, but I don't want to lead her on. I hate that my superficial prejudices could screw up an amazing connection like this. What should I do?

Because of her Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a part of her brain wasn't completely developed that is important to creating relationships and socializing, however, that is no excuse considering she is the most dedicated and smart girl I know.

POST: We've been together for about a year and I've made a new male friend (lets call him John) recently. Most of my friends are guys, so my boyfriend has gotten accustomed to it as far as I know. However, I spend a lot of time with John, and it's not because I'm interested in John romantically or anything. I've become John's support for a very serious problem he's been having, so I see him every other day at lunch, and if both my boyfriend and him are at a social event (they hardly know each other) I try to balance time for both of them.

However, for confidentiality, I don't tell my boyfriend why I'm leaving or where I go, although he knows who I'm with. I know he trusts me but if I were in his position, it would be easy to be at least a tad suspicious.

TITLE: Wanting to go to an out of area school for 6 months. How would you pull it off?
POST: I'm wanting to go to a very prestigious furniture making and design school. The best part is is that it is ran by a community college so the fees will not be insane. 
This school would be an investment for my side business in woodworking.

My question though is that I have a full-time job in healthcare. I've talked to my manager and I would not have to quit my job. I could go on Per Diem and show up to work from 2 days every 2 months to stay on payroll and retain my job. 

The school is about a three hour drive (James Krenov school of fine wood working in Fort Bragg, CA) 
And we would work 5 or 6 days a week for 10 hour days. It's very intense. 

I rent a house and make a payment on my truck. The car is paid off. 
I'd like to keep the house because I have a full sized shop detached from the house with all of my woodworking equipment and tools. 
So either I could find someone to take my room for 6 months and pay the rent or eat the bill myself (700/month) 

My greatest concern about doing this is that I would not have an income for 6 months and would probably have to find a room or apartment to go to school in the area. 

I have a gf who is a RN and said she would help me with bills and finances til I was finished but I really don't want to do that. 

I'm not sure I would qualify for student loans either aside from private loans because I fear my income might be too high, though I haven't looked. 
It looks like I'd have to live off savings.

POST: Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting my M1 - just passed the safety course and waiting for my paperwork to take the written test at the DMV.

That being said, I'm pumped up to buy my first bike and start endangering you all on the road. Which leads me to the pickle I'm in - I don't really know very much about motorcycles and what would be a good first bike. I've done the standard Google searches on ""best first bike"" and I learned on a 2008 Honda Nighthawk, so I suppose I'm leaning that direction.

What I do know is this, I want either a standard or cruiser-type bike around 250cc (maybe a little higher). I'm not looking for a sport-bike or something that's going to race, I just want to get from Point A to Point B without breaking my neck, but also looking kinda cool (i.e. NOT A SCOOTER). I've got about $2,000 to spend on the bike since there's a good chance I'll screw it up during the learning process. Any ideas or bikes you want to sell me?

Thanks!

POST: So I was seeing this girl a few months back and everything was going great. Then came the winter holidays and didn't really talk to her at all over the Christmas period and I sort of stopped fancying her. Was thinking of calling it off but thought it'd be a bit harsh given the time and didn't want it to be awkward for the NYE party we were both going to, which we ended up together at by the end of the night anyway. Since then, we haven't texted or messaged one another, sort of mutually although I feel like the ball was in my side of the court. Fine, worked out well in the end. Forgot about her. 

Have been very busy with work so not much time to do anything anyway but saw her today and it brought back a whole host of feelings and I'm not sure how to play it. Definitely would like to rekindle the flame but a) I don't know how she'll react, don't want to come off as using her as we run in similar circles and I don't want to embarrass her and b) I'm worried I'll do the exact same thing and suddenly stop fancying her.

Now, i went from a fun, technical, ever changing job, to a stale, copy&paste reporting monkey job in just a year. Its become exactly like on office space where he explains a given work week, filled with simply spacing out and barely doing anything.

TITLE: My girlfriend [25F] might get a job in another city and I [26M] am thinking to follow her
POST: Hello r/relationships,

I will try to be short. My girlfriend [25F] has an interview for a job in another city, let's called it C because it is the third city in our equation. I [26M] am from city A where I live but I work all week in city B. She is also from city B, and that's why have a common ground. (the distances are not big deal but the working schedule is hell).

Now she might get the job in city C and probably move there too. 

Obviously, I want to follow her. What is your opinion on that?

You see, to get any other job for me in any town is easy. But there are no opportunities for the field I work in any city. So it is hard to move but not impossible. 

The thing is that I don't want to lose her for anything. It will be a huge step to follow her, for both of us. We are together almost a year and she is everything for me (yeah I know, a cliche phrase but I never had anything before her. So now, I have everything).

Following her, basically means for me going to ground zero in my career  but also taking my life completely on my hands and exploring alternatives. 

Not following her, means losing her.

She knows that I am most likely to follow her but she won't demand it. 

Also, I have no one to ask these things...

Thanks everyone in advance for the time you spend on this post!

TITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?
POST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).

My income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.  Budgeting as best we can for rent, car, phones, utilities, groceries, and other routine expenses come out to around $3,000/month.  It does not cover things like trips, car repair, and other incidental expenses.

We have around $10,000 in savings, but half of that is owed to my parents over the next few months (interest free loan to help us move to my new job location).

The issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  

Since we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  

We have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.  Our thoughts were to do this for the time being and then accelerate our payments once she returns to work.  Is this a good idea?

My boyfriend and I have been official for almost 4 months, but have been close friends for the past year (it was a pretty seamless friends -> friends with benefits -> relationship transition).

He doesn't seem to see it though. He tells me that he believes I find him attractive, but doesn't necessarily agree or think he is all that great looking. He has good self-esteem in general, but I just sincerely want him to find himself as attractive as other people find him.

TITLE: My [21/M] girlfriend [21/F] constantly looks through my phone while I'm asleep. Time to end it?
POST: So my girlfriend and I have been getting along great our entire relationship. My family loves her, her family loves me, and we usually got along great.

However, she always goes through my phone while I am asleep at her house. It started before we were even official, and she woke me up at 5 in the morning crying about a text between me and a girl who I had grown up with. It was just a casual conversation between me and her, nothing that could be construed as flirtatious. 

Mind you, I've never even thought about cheating on her, the messages she freaks out and cries about are me and my friends who happen to be girls just talking. Nothing flirtatious at all. 

A year later, I can count 6 occasions where she has gone through my phone (and I've found out about it). I have caught her twice as I've come back from the bathroom, the other 4 times have been when I was asleep. When I tried putting a passcode on my phone, she asked why I did it and she accused me of trying to hide something. She was able to find out my password by looking over my shoulder one day, so I got rid of the password altogether. She has a password on her phone, but I have seen her type it in enough that I know what it is. Never have looked through it.

She has looked through my Snapchat history, Twitter favorites (""WHY WOULD YOU FAVORITE THAT GIRL'S TWEET!?!""), texts, Facebook messages, if you can think of it she's gone through it. 

I used to think it wasn't that big of a deal and that it was ""normal"" (this is my first serious girlfriend ever) until I mentioned it to my guy friends, who immediately were taken aback and said how messed up it was. 

What do you think...I've already talked to her about it and she's said she will stop, but she **never does**. Is it time to end it?

This time the girl (let's call her Caterine) I have a crush on appeared in my life 6 months ago. I met her or a classical concert I went with some of my friend, she was a close friend of one of them so we chat a little bit. I was instantly attracted to her.

2 Months later and 3 more concerts I managed to grow a pair large enough to invite her to a date (as friends, I didn't imply that I liked her that moment) so we could learn more about her.

I was charmed even more by her, she was funny, intellectual, cute, we had a lot in common, same vision of the world, same sense of humour, etc. 

We saw each other 2 or 3 more times and we started chatting over the internet, well I've been using the internet for a long time so I'm pretty nerdy in some aspects so I tried not to show that part of me to her, as it turns out she is as nerdy as me. 

We could talk about everything, from philosophy to things worthy of being in /b/ (just not that fucked up). 

So I like her. A lot. But like always I took my long ass time in knowing her so I'm kinda friendzoned now. Things are starting to look like all previous times. I have for a given that if I express my feeling towards her now I'll be rejected. 

I'm fed up of being rejected.

TITLE: I feel like my dad is cheating me out of a large amount of money. What do?
POST: I'm currently 17. I lived with my dad my entire life. My mom died in 2009 and I began receiving social security checks every month for about $600. In November (2010) part of our house burnt down and we got an insurance check for around $20,000. 

Now, my dad is not a poor guy. He makes about $30 an hour full time, and has a girlfriend who works full time as well. However, he always tells me how ""broke"" he is, and how he can't afford anything. I think this is complete bull shit. He shops at the expensive grocery store, always eats out, and buys himself expensive toys like motorcycles. And he is not in any debt. 

A few months ago I began to ask him about the social security check and the insurance money. He told me that he was able to take care of me financially (as in buying food, health insurance, etc.), but the only thing he can't afford is my car insurance. So basically, he's saying that the only part of my social security check that is being used on me is for car insurance. So where the hell is the rest of the $600 going? He doesn't even pay for my phone bill, gas, or clothes. This I have to pay for myself, even though I have no income. Actually, he did buy me a HALF tank of gas once. But his girlfriend told him not to do that anymore. I feel like she's in on this too. 

 As for the insurance money, we got the check in about January and I have not seen a cent of it. I believe I lost about $700 worth of stuff in the fire, and only one thing has been replaced. He agreed to buy me a new computer instead of giving me money, which I agreed to.  NOW, he's saying I need to give him $300 and then he will buy me a computer. 

Then my cat got sick. The bill was around $600 and now he's saying that I need to pay him. (My cat is still living with him, unfortunately.)

Our relationship has been particularly rocky lately. But

POST: As usual this didn't happen today, it actually happened around 10 years ago when I was in grade 4 or 5.

I was not the most popular kid in school back in the day, probably starting from around grade 2 nobody liked me and my friends. It did suck being hated by so many, but things were a lot worse for the 2nd tier dorks. There was a few kids in my school that would wander the play ground alone and cause all girls to run away in fear if they ever got close. Seeing as I also got a similar, less disgusted reaction from everybody I felt bad for one of these kids. I started talking to him, joking with him, overall trying to cheer him up and this is were things went down hill.

It was a normal day in class, me and the weird kid said hello, talked a bit and then he insisted that he sat next to me. I didn't really mind and continued on with my work. I started noticing he kept staring at me without saying anything but I just ignored it, seeing as he was 'the weird kid'. A few minutes later, with the speed of 6 hyenas, he jumped forward and bit me on the arm. For about a second or two I sat there, completely bewildered as he nibbled on my arm. After realizing it was actually hurting a lot, I pushed him away and yanked my blood covered arm right out of his slimy gob. He looked at me and apologized as I turned and ran to the teacher. When the teacher asked the kid why he savagely barraged my arm with nibbles, he just straight up said ""I was hungry"".

Alot of time whenever I'm talking to/skyping/etc with my girlfriend i'm worrying that i did something wrong and that she is weirded out or mad at me and just isn't telling me. It doesn't help that this is a long distance relationship so we rarely get to see each other in person (like every 2 months at best). 

This is likely entirely my fault, although it could be caused by what happened in a previous (semi-)relationship that I was in where the girl lied to me extensively and now I feel insecure and unable to trust any reaction my girlfriend has, even though I do love her with all of my heart.

This is having an effect on me as a person..

TITLE: Girl had nip slip in photo, Blamed on me.
POST: I was with friends and we were going through pictures on facebook when we came across this photo from this years prom where a girl has a nip slip. It is barely visable, but we noticed it. (I should have reported the picture for nudity, but with friends i didn't think of it. We agreed to not tell anyone about it. However on of them ended up telling one of his friends, and that friend told others, and it spread to mostly everyone in the school. The girl in my school now found out from a kid. that mostly everyone doesn't like, that ""I have a picture of a nip slip, work on yearbook and prom commity, (which i don't) and showed everyone."" 
What should i do, I already told the girl that i am not involved with anything and that the kid is basically making it all up.
Should i ""throw him under the bus"", just as he did to me, or should i just leave it alone now.

POST: Me 26 Her 28

Having a tough time on my own with this one. I'm realizing how much my pride and ego are controlling a recent incident and if they're good indicators on wether I should take my gf back or not.        

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 3 years. There's been ups and downs recently and in early February we broke up, but were still in contact with each other everyday. Earlier last month the GF left on a trip for two weeks. The day before she left we reconnected and It seemed like we were getting back together. We made a promise to not sleep with anyone and to talk more when she gets back. I send her some brief emails, she comes across really distant so I back off a little, not wanting to smother her. She gets back and we click, get along amazingly, it feels like a fresh start between us and I couldn't be happier. 

Now she tells me that she slept with some guy while on the trip. I'm angry, hurt etc. Today had a face to face talk where I forgave her but also said we shouldn't be together or talk anymore. She's a wreck right now to say the least, extremely remorseful.   

I understand we weren't technically together, but she made a promise to me before she left. I do love her. I want to forgive and forget, but the images and fact of it happening keep eating away at any thought of her I have.

POST: I am not biased towards religion nor am I biased for or against atheism. I try not judge people by their personal beliefs because I know we are all different, either through evolution or through some supreme being. It doesn't matter to me if you think that God created us, or if we are space farts; fact of the matter is that we are all different for some reason or another. People will believe what they want to believe or not believe. The ones who accept everyone to this degree and see that we all can use values from some source or religion/non-religion are the outstanding people. However, the longer I lurk and browse Reddit, the more I see that the atheism subreddit demands the most attention. They follow one another's' beliefs as if they were following a religion, and though they do not have a leader or supreme being, they do enjoy posting links that breed the same hate and intolerance as other religions do. I would like to think that some people are different and that perhaps a subreddit that would speak of indifference towards others would exist somewhere; and some people would motion for that change of universal tolerance of everyone and everything; however I now see that /r/atheism is just another religion. I'm sorry to those who cannot speak their mind in any religious or nonreligious threads for fear of losing karma or getting down voted and that as much as the followers of /r/atheism try to say they are not a hivemind and that they speak out as individuals, collectively they are a group. I fully expect to be downvoted for this post, but I would like to see if there is anyone lurking around that just believe in being kind, generous, loving, caring, and all those ""good"" things, without the need for religious or non-religious gratification. Do people like this exist, or are we a dying breed? And look at that, now that I read my own post I suppose it is human nature to judge someone even if you don't want to. Guess I'll just stick to f7u12 for some laughs and leave the rest alone.

TITLE: TIFU by Letting my Brothers onto an Social Experiment I was Planning.
POST: Not so recently, my grandma was put into a personal care home due to a broken hip and both of her daughters just not having the time to be able to care for her as she needs to be. More recently, the pitbull that the couple who run this home has had a litter of puppies. Out of the 8, 7 survived and 1 of those is the second smallest of the litter. She is extremely shy and the mother extremely protective of her. I decided I was going to name all of the pups and get the owners of the care home to start calling each pup by the name I had given them. There is Chewie, Shiva, Alfalfa, Spanky, Sugar Plum, Tommy, and finally, the focus of my fuck up, Fluttershy. She is the center of my social experiment. Since these pups will soon be fit to be taken away from their mother, I was going to use Shy as a way to figure out a rough estimate as to how many bronies live in my area, outside of high school and college, by how many prospective adopters catch on to the name. The fact that the pup is named after a pony from a TV show escaped from everyone, until today, when, in a discussion about Amnesia, I mention Alois from the Justine DLC of Amnesia. Both of my brothers ask who he is and I explain to them the previous information and am met with blank looks. I explain to them again as follows:

""Yeah, you remember, they took Fluttershy (the pony, not the pup) and made her into him in 'A Small Horse?'"" (A custom story for Amnesia for those who don't know)

And that's when they connected the dots and questioned after my reasons for naming a beautiful and shy little pitbull pup after an animated pony from a TV show.

POST: I found out recently that I have a medical condition that makes it very difficult for me to conceive, and very, very risky for me and the baby. If I were to get pregnant, I would have to take a shot of heparin (blood thinner) in my stomach twice a day to reduce the risk of miscarriage, and thrombosis. 

So basically, i've decided that I am not going to bother with pregnancy, and I have let my boyfriend of two years know this as well. Yet, for some reason, he still brings up ""when we have our own kids!"", ""when you're pregnant, and I have to rush you to emerge"", or ""I can't wait until I get to create a little life.""

And every time, I have to remind him that it's not really possible and he gets really sad. We have talked about adoption, but I don't know if he is that interested in adopting. 

I just wish I could be that pregnant girlfriend or wife he wants in the future, but at the same time I wish he could be sensitive to the fact that I can't and wont have kids.

TITLE: I [24 M] ended a very new relationship with a long time friend [24 F] because we seemed to want different things out of our relationship. She seemed to agree when I brought it up to her, but now I am not sure if I did the right thing.
POST: So I had met this girl when I started this new job. She worked there for a few months after I got hired, then moved onto a different career path. But was still a part of the social circle I was a part of. I had a huge crush on her soon after, she did not reciprocate that feeling. I was a little sour about it, but decided to remain cordial to her as she was still in my immediate social circle. 

Fast forward a few years, we had each gone off and dated other people, but also grew to become close friends through out this time. Then about two months ago, after a few drinks together, she out of the blue kisses me, thus spawns our relationship. 

As you can see, I had some mixed feelings about this, as i don't really appreciate being the ""ace up some ones sleeve"". But I chose to pursue this because I had to at least try.  Things are fine for a few weeks, we dated pretty casually, saw each other once or twice a week at most. Then she started to grow distant, like she didn't ever have any time to see me etc. After it had been almost three weeks since I had seen her or even had a meaningful conversation with her I confronted her about it. After arguing via text message for a few days, I understood that she just wanted a much more casual relationship than what I had wanted. I told her that this relationship wasn't going to make either of us happy since we want different things out of it. She agreed and we both decided to remain friends, as there wasn't any animosity towards each other. 

I felt it was a necessary decision at the time, but after a few days have passed, I feel like I may have done the wrong thing for the right reasons, and that I have thrown away a chance to be in a decent relationship with some one I enjoy.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. 

Our relationship for the most part has been pretty good. We get along well in nearly every capacity - life plans, sex, etc. I'm very happy with him.

Yesterday he asked me to move in with him. I'm graduating college this fall, and am looking for a job in the same area he works.

When he asked, I realized... I really don't want to live with him. And I feel my reasons are kind of stupid.

I'm very close to my family, and I feel living with him would impede my ability to see them often. I travel to go see them and I don't want him to come with me. It's not that they don't like him - quite the opposite. I just don't like having him there. I have to entertain him, and he takes away from my ability to be with them. 

Also, I want to move in my parents someday. I know he's against moving in his or my parents in the future, but I wish to live with mine. 

Finally, I really enjoy being alone. I don't enjoy having him at my apartment longer than a few days - I begin to crave being fully alone.

I really do love him. But I don't know if this is a sign of a bigger issue or not. What should I say to him? Do you guys think this means anything?

She talks to guys from her past. She talks weekly to 2 exes, which I'm fine with, but we recently got into a big fight, because she was texting, snapchatting and calling another guy who was either a fuck buddy, or used her for sex, or something along those lines, from her past. She yelled at me ""I WILL TALK TO WHO I WANT TO TALK TO!!!!!! YOU DONT DESERVE TO KNOW MY PAST!!""

Initially, she was mad that I called her out on him being suspicious and her being secretive about this person. They talked infrequently for 2 months while in our relationship, and she kept her history with them and that they were talking at all, a secret. I told her I don't care if she has a past, I just don't like it when the past comes back around. I found out they were talking by seeing her best friends on Snapchat. She's always been one to delete all the texts her in phone.

Recently, I've been in these group chats with old elementary school friends, mostly the same 2-3 girls, and they just talk about some of the sketchy people from our class and where the heck they made it off to. We party together in the summer, but they've never been more than friends.

Anyways, now my GF is pissed that I'm talking to one good looking female friend, from elementary school, she says she's a slut and has ulterior motives. I would stop talking to her, but I think I first need to make it clear that my gf said she is going to talk to who she wants to, yet she's trying to control who I talk to.

There are always guys from her past, buzzing around our relationship, putting me down because I'm younger, etc. She has a lot of sexual partners, and they seem to come back around. I have none, so every girl I talk to, has only ever been just a friend.

POST: We've known each other since teenagers and been through a lot together.  She recently got engaged and is planning on having her wedding in Morocco because that's where her family (and fiance) originate. Despite wanting to be there for her special day, there's several reasons why I don't want to go:

1) She has cheated multiple times on her fiance and does not plan on ever telling him. I've always told her I disapproved (but agreed to not tell anyone) but I'm scared I might do something impulsively on the day.

2) I've been to Morocco last yr with her where we stayed with her family and I loathed everything. I'm a city girl through and through, I struggled with the heat, lack of hygiene, mannerisms etc (sorry to any moroccans, nothing personal I just prefer clean concrete type places)

3) I found the residents and her family rude and racist. I am asian, which obviously made me stand out and I was often stared at and had racist remarks shouted at me throughout (to the point where I almost bought a ticket to go home early, it was that bad). Even caught strangers taking pictures of me several times. Her family were civil but I caught them talking about me multiple times when they thought I wasn't aware and I could tell they weren't saying nice things. (I'm not saying everyone there is a racist obviously but the experience was very upsetting and scarring for me). 

4) Don't want to waste money on the plane ticket as I am struggling financially (I'm a uni student). 

What should I do? Am I just being selfish for not wanting to go (after all it's her wedding day)?

POST: I only think it is fair I should begin.

So growing up in a small town everybody knows everybody but once in awhile we got a rare chance to go to these massive house parties out in the country. These parties were usually thrown by really rich kids with massive houses and tons of money to throw away and what was my favorite part was that since these kids were in a different school district we never really knew them or had to see them on a regular basis.

So we're at this party having a great time and what not but like I'm prone to do I drink waaay to much and pass out. So I'm laying on the sofa when suddenly its like Jesus himself brings me forth and is like ""Steve, you need to piss NOW"". So I jump up.

Y'know when you need to piss but there is like this subconscious countdown that begins in your head? You're like ""I gotta pee...but I got like 5 minutes until systems go critical."" Well I just woke up from my beer-coma and systems were beyond critical. 

So I start running towards my best guess where a bathroom might be but as this is a massive house I get a little lost. I run into a dark room and think ""Fuck it. I'm not peeing myself."" So I whip down my pants and start peeing.

I hear this weird hissing noise but I'm too busy feeling relieved to care so once I'm done I zip up and walk away.

A few minutes later people are saying they can smell something really rank, kinda like piss. I can smell it too.

So this smell is permeating throughout the house and everyone is talking about it trying to find the source. Finally this girls who's throwing the party Dad comes down and starts investigating.

He comes back a few minutes later red as a child's freshly spanked bottom and screams ""WHO PISSED ON THE FURNACE!?""

But it's left me in a state of confusion.  Part of me misses him a lot because we were good friends and were there for each other when a lot of crazy shit was happening.  But part of me knows that he is too intense and I'm really not equipped to emotionally handle him without throwing myself into depression and anxiety.  I know I got closure from the experience, but I don't think it was the closure I wanted/expected.

POST: Short backstory: I've known him for about 4.5 years, he got divorced last year, we've been seeing each other for about two months. As long as I've known him I've never seen him smoke. It's not a secret that I absolutely hate the habit (cigarettes). I just think it's disgusting and I personally don't (usually) date guys that smoke. I just prefer not to be grossed out by a guy I'm dating. 

I went to his place this past Saturday and saw a pack of cigarettes and I asked him about it, and he said that he has occasionally had one when he gets drunk, but rarely, and that he meant to throw the pack out. 

Last night we went out to the bar and after a little while he asked if I minded if he went to make a phone call he forgot to make earlier. When he came back inside, I thought I caught a whiff of it, and he sat a little further away from me than usually for ~20 minutes or so. Looked like he may have had a pack in his pocket, but I didn't see it so I can't be sure. That was the one and only time I've suspected it. 

I realize in the grand scheme of things that this isn't a huge deal, but I'm not sure what to do. I like him enough at this point that I wouldn't break things off because of it, but I'm not even sure how to bring it up. I'm big on honesty, and he hasn't lied to me or anything as far as I can tell, so I'm not worried about that. Do I bring it up? Do I just ignore it for now and see if it even becomes an issue?

We have a lease together until August 2015. We are wanting to take a 1-month break in order to re-evaluate our relationship, decide what our needs are, and try to ""fall back in love"" with eachother. The sizzle is just gone. 

Has anyone here ever taken a break from an SO and still lived with them? If so, what were your rules about it? 

Ours are: minimal talking, no sex, no sex with other people, he stays in the spare bedroom.

TITLE: I *Might* be a father again. How am I supposed to handle this? [25M]
POST: I had a fling for about a month with a girl back in September. We had unprotected sex but I pulled out.... which I know isn't perfect. Yesterday, she called me and wanted to talk. Apparently she is pregnant and she is saying I am the father. I don't know if I believe her since our ""relationship"" was very casual. I don't really want to be the father either. 

I'm probably going to get flamed for this but I am married so its really preferable that this isn't my child. My wife and I have been going through a tough period and the fling was borderline cheating. We were apart but still together. So its complicated. Wife and I have been together for 4 years and we have a 3 yo son and an 8 month old daughter together. Since the fling ended my wife and I have been communicating so much better and we are in a good place again. This would fuck it all up. 

The girl I had the fling with didn't seem like she was going to have an abortion. She doesn't know I'm married so maybe it changes after that. I guess I would like to not be the father or there not to be a baby. My question is what should my move be? What do I need to be doing right now?

I'm 25/m and this girl is 20/f. My wife is 22/f.

POST: I work in retail with someone who I seem to have a good chemistry with and I think she would agree if I were to ask her, but the problem is that we never have a moment where I can do that.

We work in different departments and see each other pretty regularly but theres always customers or coworkers around. I've known her for about 2 months. Is it okay to ask her if she wants to see a movie or something in front of coworkers? Id really rather nobody else be around but its so rare that were alone and so brief. I thought about passing her a note but that seems childish and kinda cheesy. I wouldnt mind asking her out in front of coworkers if I knew she was going to say yes but if she said no or she's busy in front of coworkers Id feel embarrassed.

 It would mean a lot to me if I could get at least a few people to give me their opinions on this. Thank you for your time.

TITLE: I (22/F) think I have feelings for (25/M). Can't tell if it's mutual (x-post from r/wemetonline)
POST: Heyooo,

So, I met this guy online on a non-dating website 6 months ago. We started talking every day, we've video chatted a few times, and we've exchanged literally thousands of messages to each other. It was gradual at first and in the beginning of our online friendship he said that I was easy to talk to because of the distance between us. I am in the US and he is in the UK.

Now, I'm preparing a trip to see him in two-ish months. He was hinting at it and I went right out with it and told him that I could come and visit him. He said he'd love it if I did.

I'm starting to get feelings for this guy. I get excited when I get messages from him. I get butterflies. It's weird because we've never met before but we've been talking pretty much every single day for 6 months.

I don't know if it's a mutual feeling or not. Could it be completely platonic if we've been talking every single day for 6 months and we've agreed on me leaving to the uk to meet him? Do you think there could be something more there or no?

Most of the messages are friendly type but he has given me a few compliments and stuff like that. I just don't know how to tell if there might be feelings on his end too because I've never communicated to this level with someone online that I've never met. I don't know how to tell or if there are any signs that there might be more there and we're just not saying it.

What are some signs that it is mutual and some signs that it's not? What do you think?

TITLE: I [28 M] suspect my Wife [29 F] of 2 years may be cheating. Need advice.
POST: My wife and I have been growing apart lately (lack of intimacy for about 3 months) and I've noticed a couple strange things that I want some unbiased opinions on.

 She goes to the gym 5 days a week for a couple hours. One day recently when she was leaving she said goodbye and then I heard her phone start giving her GPS directions. Why would she need directions to the gym she's been going to for a year? Is it reasonable to believe she had accidentally hit 'go' to somewhere else she was looking up earlier?

The other day in the car I saw an obvious text conversation open and asked (in a friendly way, not accusatory) who she was talking to. She quickly moved her phone and said she was browsing amazon. Multiple other times I've seen her quickly hide her phone or laptop as I've looked over. I've gotten a clear look a couple of times and it was absolutely a text message program.  

Mistrust is probably the quickest killer of a relationship and I haven't acted on any of this. I understand the severity of me even suspecting this. All of these could be innocent coincidences but together they've got me concerned.

How I see it I've got a couple of options:

A) Do nothing and let this either go away or eventually explode.

B) Ask her about it directly. I've asked her about the texts in the moment and she's lied, so I'm not sure if this would work.

C) Try getting access to her phone and see if there are any incriminating texts. This one would be risky and would absolutely damage our marriage if she found out. I really, really don't want to fuck this marriage up because of my paranoia.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my ex [25 F] broke up and I feel guilty and sad since I initiated it
POST: We had been dating for about six months and things were going reasonably well. I liked her and she liked me. I'd say there wasn't a very intense passion to the relationship, but there was definite affection towards each other. Both of us cared for each other deeply without question.

Yet I felt like something was missing. I wanted there to be passion in the relationship. I was always excited about seeing her and every so often tried my best to escalate things and take it to the bedroom, though she only was comfortable doing so a handful of times (fewer than five times) during the entire course of our relationship. She often made excuses about not wanting to get physical - either she was on her period (I had no issue with this), or she was PMSing or she said she hadn't taken her birth control. She often seemed to have a reason like that and obviously I didn't ever want to be pushy so I always felt compelled to drop it even though this frustrated me greatly.

I feel guilty that something like this was such a sticking factor to me. Almost like it's supposed to be too trivial a reason, but to me it wasn't. I wanted more with her. And even told her about it. She just didn't seem to want anything to change. 

I broke up with her recently, telling her that there were some incompatibilities that I couldn't handle anymore but never actually saying what it was because it didn't seem to me like I needed to be that blunt about it. I haven't heard from her since, so I'm not sure how she's even taking this. But I feel horrible, partly because I know I probably hurt her feelings by breaking up so suddenly out of the blue and partly because my heart hurts from having to end things with a wonderful human being. 

I haven't reached out to her since then either. But this whole thing makes me sad. I'm usually the one on the receiving end of breakups and it actually sucks to be the one who initiated it. I feel guilty about it and it hurts.

I don't necessarily have a question. I guess I just needed to talk about it. If anyone has any words of advice or wisdom, I'm all ears.

The girl and I are in a close relationship, and she tried to hide the fact they were back together. Frustrated me pretty badly. I've asked why they got back together, and she said because he deserved a second chance, so I told her I didn't want to see her go through this break-up again (last time, it was quite emotional) and she said she would ""deal with it"". 
She's being very calloused when talking, and just kinda abrasive when we're not talking face to face (ex. texting). Last time, the guy pretty much cheated on her and called her bitchy. I've been nothing but good to her, and yet she still chooses this guy over me. I know, I sound like an egotistical jerk, but I'm really confused right now. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. if you need more info, just comment. Thanks!

POST: This is a fight we had 2 times before, it's hard on our relationship, and if she doesn't get an explenation that it isn't going to happen anymore it's the end. Relationship of 2,5 years.

We are 2 outgoing people, we do alot of fun things, together or with friends, we respect eachothers boundaries, and do what we want to do.

Whenever we're out, we tend to hit the bars, and drink. Whenever my girlfriend is out with her friends, she tends to be drunk.

Last week, she had a busy agenda, going out 5 days out of 7. I had to work, the only time i heard her that week was her to tell me, how rought the party was (not mentioning drinks), or that it was very late in the morning, this is on monday, wednsday, thursday, friday, saturday, she doesn't work and only has to do her finals for this year. in my mind i start to think, damn, she's 5/7 drunk. Which is a negative quality, and i get frustrated, building up resentment untill i see her and then it explodes in her face. Telling her i don't love her anymore, think she's a marginal, cause she's always drunk, i want to end the relationship. I regret this now. (i should've told her before, instead of building it up, my bad)

Now, i get the full blaim, she asks me or i don't trust her, she says she can't touch a drink anymore when i'm around, i need help to figure out what's causing the problem.

I have a double feeling about this.

So isn't the outcome told to us really a matter of faith? We just have to believe that the people in charge are moral and telling us the truth.

*I never wash/shower at his house except when I brush my teeth.     
*I never use electricity for my own things except for *one* day when I stayed home to do some homework in peace away from my own household - which I realise would raise suspicions - but this was months ago now.
*My boyfriend *assures* me that the cost of bills has not increased since the beginning of our relationship. I get paranoid about our relationship with his housemates, so am often asking him if I'm leaving an expensive footprint but he says no.     
*I generally do not use anything that my boyfriend wouldn't have been using anyway.

Generally speaking, I make a conscious effort to not abuse my stay. Admittedly, I do stay til late in the morning sometimes but **only** if I start work later, and this is because I'll sleep later. I do not ever lie in his bed sucking up all the electricity watching TV etc.

TITLE: Why do I [23f], who has an amazing family and loving friends with a good life, hate myself? And how can I get past it?
POST: So this is me... I have a loving and amazing family. I have many loving friends. I have a great social life. It is easy for me to get the guy I want. I've just recently started talking to a really great guy, who really cares about me and likes me. So everythings cool and gravy and dandy so why do I not like myself so much???

I have wondered if it might be because I have been hurt a lot by guys I've dated/talked to. My dad left me when I was 8. I feel as though every man will leave me. (Trying to convince myself that this current guy wont hurt me, but can't really believe it). 

Recently after a very devastating breakup, for months I could feel nothing but hate for myself. What's wrong with me that he would leave and never speak to me again? I'm a good person. What part of me could they have hated so much to just throw me aside like I was nothing? It killed me. To clarify, this is not the reason why I started feeling like I didn't like myself. This feeling has been around for years. It is just after this breakup did I feel at my lowest, most terrible low. 

So sometimes when I am alone I will sit and want to cry because I don't like myself. And when I try to figure out why, I hate myself more because I truly can't find a reason. I know I'm not a bad person. I've never done anything to hurt anyone. I enjoy making others happy. I've never told any of my friends or family how I feel because they would have no idea either. They would tell me that I shouldn't feel like that. And I know I shouldn't but I can't help it and it is a terrible feeling. So i thought I would post here to see if anyone could relate/help out?

POST: So this happened just today. We're in highschool and me and my three friends (lets call them Bob, Steven and Tong) were eating lunch and chilling. We were making fun of Bob as we usually do and then Tong brings up the topic of the Charlie, Charlie pencil game (if you don't know what it is then go on youtube). We all tried it except for Bob and the pencil didn't move. So we all persuaded Bob to join in and I had this amazing thought. What if I just scared the shit out of my friends. 

Now, Tong and Bob were paranoid from this game for some weird reason and get scared easily. So when Bob said Charlie, Charlie come play with me, I decided to quietly blow the pencil to 'Yes'. Tong started screaming and ran so fast around the corner. Bob was probably scared as crap because it only worked for him, and Steven and I are just laughing our asses off.

Me and my friends calmed down and we all started trying it for ourselves. Steven, Tong and I tried it and I blew it to 'No' all 3 times. Then Bob tried it again and i blew it to 'Yes'. 

My friends were scared shitless. I would be surprised if Tong comes to school tommorow.

I just came out of a meeting where I was told that mistakes were not acceptable in my position. It was intimidating because I know I will continue to make them.

I have worked the job I have for eight months, sort of. I was in logistics for 7 months. Then got moved to sales as a supervisor in January, which are really two totally different careers. But not to my GM. He asserted that after 8 months I should have all the mistakes out of my system.

Other than that I do very well. My sales are great. My customer service is top rated. I solved or diffused any number of problems daily in logistics. Of course, the one you miss is the one that gets noted, but that's just how it works.

POST: My boyfriend and I are discussing moving in together in the fall when his lease is up. We've been together for just over a year.

We both make a similar salary. He makes about $2K more than I do. We have been discussing how to share expenses and split the bills. We are both open to communication and discussion on this life change.

Expect is a strong word here, but I would expect this would be a landlord-tenant style relationship in the sense that I would cover all household expenses related to home maintenance. Plumbing, electrical, roofing, appliances ... If anything breaks, then that's on me. With regards to bills we both contribute to (water, electricity, internet, etc), I'd expect to split those down the middle. With regards to the monthly payment, I'd also expect to split that down the middle. The reason for that is that it's a reasonable amount that's about equivalent to his current apartment rent. If we were to find a place to rent together, the expectation would be that we'd split a rent payment 50/50. I see the house as a shared space so I think it's reasonable that we share the expense of the house.

On the other hand, I will be building equity in the home and he will not. However, I did put down $60K of my own money when I purchased the house.

I'm just not sure what to do. The relationship would be perfect if it weren't for his jealousy and insecurity. I am just not sure if these things can be changed. When we're not talking about this stuff, we have a good relationship. These conversations make me SO angry though! He always threatens to break up with me, says I'm not showing him enough attention in public (wtf?), says that we don't have enough sex (twice a day isn't enough?), says that I don't do enough for him...and then he starts talking about the past again and all the people I slept with. He wants me to delete pictures of past exes on facebook because he doesn't want to see me having fun with other guys. What the hell?

There are just so many red flags, and I KNOW this. I know I should probably break up with him. It makes me mad even typing all this stuff out. I guess I just needed to vent, really.... I haven't told anyone else about this because I don't have many friends.

TITLE: Me [22 M] and my best friend [22F] got into a relationship - I need help
POST: We have been best friends since high school, we talked about everything and everybody and always had a good time together. She was the perfect ""best friend"", someone who would stay with you, the rest of your life. And then we got even closer. She fell in love with me, I couldnt hurt her so we started to evolve into a couple. The relationship has been official for a few months now, but we have been acting like a couple for over a year. I fear any advice might be too late.

The thing is: I like her, but I want to be single ( - doesn't really have to make sense to you, as long as it makes sense to me) 
I am old enough to know, that if I would break up with her I will lose her and our lives will seperate, but I really want her to be a part of mine.
I regret that I was too weak to say ""no"" to her, for our friendships sake.
But I know she is perfect for me, would be the perfect wife, but I am not ready for this. I now wish I would have met her in a few years, when I would actually be looking for that special someone.

I don't know what to do right now. I am happy when I'm with her, but I feel that there will be an end to the relationship (maybe in a few months, maybe in a few years, who knows).
Is there any possible way I wont lose her as soon as this is over? Can we somehow manage to stay friends? Does anybody have any experience or advice for me?

TITLE: My Boyfriend [15m] Broke up with Me [17f] and is spreading Rumors about me. I don't want to break up, Help?
POST: I asked about this before but didnt really get any help :/ My boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me last weekend, and now he's spreading rumors about me around school. He's saying that I'm psycho/crazy and a bunch of stuff. What happened that led to the breakup is that some girl was texting him saying flirty stuff, he wasn't flirting back but she wasn't being appropriate at all and she knew he had a girlfriend.

I read some of these texts, I didn't go through his phone or anything. He left it in his room when he was in another and he got a text and I was going to bring it to him but it was from a girl so I just checked it. I didnt respond but I texted her from my phone and asked who she was and why she's texting my boyfriend and she told my boyfriend that i read their conversation and texted her.

Then he asked me about it and I just said I was worried and he said I'm overprotective and crazy and stuff and I got really upset with him and he broke up with me. I want to try to stay together but he pretty much hates me now, and he still talks to this girl, i saw in his twitter messages thing and I don't want them to end up dating or something. What can I do about the rumors and this whole situation? I really don't want to break up and I think he just did it out of anger.

TITLE: I don't know if I should believe him.
POST: I'm an exchange student in a foreign country and in the group of exchanges there is this guy, he's cute but I didn't really notice him until he helped me out with when I was breaking up with my boyfriend. It's not what it sounds like, he actually advised me to stay with him. And we became friends, not super close.. but yeah, closer.

Then his birthday came around maybe like a month later and we both got drunk and he asked me to kiss him, we made out.. then he left and we didn't talk about it. The next weekend it happened again, but before it did I asked him why, he said because he liked me a lot. We left the club and went to watch a movie, we made out through it and he asked me if I thought I was ready for a relationship, I answered honestly and said no, plus we'd have to go back to our own countries soon, (3 months from now).

We went on a date then back to our countries for Christmas and that was it. But I was the one who suggested we meet.

The day before, it happened all over again, we went out got a little tipsy, and he started declaring his love. It was a little silly, but he kept insisting that the wasn't that drunk (I've seen him much worse) and that he just didn't know how to say this any other way. He asked me out. I was a little taken aback. I said we'd talk about it later.
But the next morning, nothing.

I'm really sick of this cycle. We make out, then we ignore the subject. I want to believe everything he says and believe him that he's using the alcohol as a means to express his feelings. But the sensible part of me doubts it. So I asked him if we could meet up to talk about it as it was silly that we haven't ever talked about it, and he agreed.

My question is, am I silly in asking him to talk about it? Should I just leave it and have some self control around him?
I thought when you like someone you make an effort to try to be with them. He only seems to be interested in me when he's had a few.

TITLE: [19M] My girlfriend [19F] always wants to be at home.
POST: Were both university students that live with our parents and have been dating for two years. For the most part things are great and we love each other a lot however since we first started dating I don't get to see her as much as I like because she always wants to be at home with her parents. This isn't just a problem with me, she barely has any friends anymore because she always turns down plans so she can be at home.

I ask her to hang out 2-3 times a week. Most of the time though she just responds that she is going to ""stay at home that day"". I could understand that if she never got to relax at home but the problem is she is at her house all the time since she has no hobbies, job, or friends.

Sometimes we go swimming, bowling, snowboarding or other things and she has a great time and says we should do that again, but then whenever I ask her to go do them again she turns down the idea.

Therefore usually when we do hang out we end up at either my house or her's. I wouldn't mind this too much except she doesn't like watching movies or TV, playing video games or board games. So there's nothing to do but lie around. Additionally her Parents don't allow sleep overs or staying past 9.

2 days ago i decided to have sex again with an other girl and it was really bad (physical and emotionally)

THE MEETING FROM YESTERDAY

we didnt contact each other since the breakup and she wrote me 

via Facebook that she wants to meet me to discuss everything

so we met in my home and discussed a bit and she found out that i had sex with someone else because i had a teared open condom package and there where cigarette fags with red lipstick in my ashtray(i wanted to tell it her later,but whatever) after that she telled me that she also had sex a week before with a friend of her. Then i was jealous and she was also jealous but tried to act like she is not jealous (she confessed it later)

We talked about our future and she meant that she dont know but she cannot be without me and that she cant be in a relationship with me.

After that we spend the day with cuddling,having Sex and watching The X-Files and she said the whole day long that she missed this

THE PROBLEM

Now i dont have any clue how i should react to it and i could think about our future or how i could heal my jealousy, it seems that she cannot be in a relationship with me,but she also cannot be not in a relationship with me.

TITLE: Stuck with a used car that I am making payments on that is constantly breaking down. What should I do? Trade it in for something newer/more reliable, or continuing repairing and pay off/own the car in 3.5 more years? I don't have anyone really to ask... A bad move on my part.
POST: Hi everyone,

I bought my first non-Craigslist car, a 2005 Honda Civic SI with 79,000 miles on it, from a Honda dealer back in February 2013 for $10,000 + taxes, fees, a shitty warranty that I wish I did not purchase, etc. Everything came out to around $15,000. I put $5,000 down and financed the other $10,000 over the course of 5 years at a 10.9% interest rate. My monthly payment is around $240. 

Prior to this I owned a 2003 Toyota Matrix XR which I paid cash for an owned. I should have kept this. 

My Civic so far, over the past year, has cost me almost $2,500 in repairs. I've replaced the fuel pump, knock sensor (happening now), rotors, brakes, belts, rack and pinion, and the clutch now has about 107,000 miles on it and is starting to slip pretty bad. It is in the shop as we speak having the knock sensor replaced, and there is also a moaning/squeaking noise when I come out of first gear that I'm sure will be another problem. I feel like the car is going to continue breaking down and unfortunately my warranty does not cover any of this since it is considered ""normal wear"" on the car. 

I think that money could have gone towards payments and I feel kind of dumb for even buying the car (still completely stock, but I wanted something faster than my Martix (idiot move)). My question comes to this. Should I trade it in for something newer (I have pretty good credit of about 750) or pay off the remaining $7,500 I have left and then own the car while I continue to pay for repairs?

TITLE: What's your best example of beginner's luck?
POST: Could be your own beginner's luck, or beginner's luck from someone else at your expense.

For me, it was about 2 months ago. I was invited to play some poker with a friend and some of his other buddies.  Up until that point, I'd never played a single hand of poker in my life but knew the hierarchy of hands and that was about it.

I turned up late and missed the beginning of the game and they'd replaced me with someone else, but I stuck around to hang out.  To be honest, I was pretty pleased I wouldn't have to lose any money anyway.  Eventually, as people started dropping out, a side game started while the big game went on in the next room. It was a $10 buy-in and I started playing poker for the first time in my life.

I came away with a $37 profit an hour or so later.  I think the fact I wasn't experience enough to figure out strategy actually helped me.  The others didn't know my style and I didn't know theirs (or mine).  I made some dumb mistakes and I got really lucky on some hands, but I just used common sense and tried to weigh up my options as best I could and it worked out.  I haven't played since but I'm positive it won't turn out like that next time!

TITLE: 21/F UPDATE. I confronted his fiancé.
POST: Link to original post. 

First, I just wanted to say thank you to all that replied and sent me personal messages regarding this issue of mine. You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.

After I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fiancée. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.

So I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.

The evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with ""Are you sure you don't have a fiancée?"" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. 

I took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.

We talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.

It wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.

We may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.

I don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.

POST: So my girlfriend on and off for 3 years is spending the summer studying abroad while I'm working. Before she left I broke up with her because she chose studying abroad and then moving back with her parents after (halfway across the world) over staying with me. She begged and pleaded to give long distance a chance; and I was convinced it could work so we got back together. This was 3 weeks ago. Last night, she breaks up with me with a few brief texts. On a Saturday night. In shock, I reply back flippantly and that was that. It's been a day and as I've been stewing it's making me more and more upset. Just the DAY before, she was telling me how she loved me and what not.

I can only assume she either cheated or is suddenly caught up in the fervor of partying abroad and wants to sleep around. Either way, it was a cold cold way to end a 3 year relationship. I had no idea she was that kind of person; I really never saw it coming. Should I bother finding out what went wrong, what the situation is?

So I unzipped by shorts and whipped out my donger and started pissing on my friend a little. He got a bit pissed and started punching me in return. I was trying to block his punches cos he was drunk and was punching pretty hard. After he stopped, I was complaining about the punches and shit then I went back to raving and grinding with the girl I was hooking up with. The thing is that I forgot to put my donger back in my shorts so he was raving with me. All my mates were laughing, the girl I was with turned around and laughed too but I was too drunk to care and continued for a while until 10-15 minutes later this stranger came up with me and pointed at my donger. I shoved it back in whilst everyone was still laughing. Again I was too drunk to give a fuck so I just raved on. The girl was cool with it and stayed with me still. But the thing is that my donger was flying and raving with me when probably everyone around saw it.

TITLE: My 13 year old brother killed our bird out of anger. What can we do to help him?
POST: Here's how it happened: 

My mother was scolding him for his mess and told him to do fold some towels. Before there are any suspicions, my mom wasn't scolding him in a demeaning or abusing way; she is just tired of telling him over and over again to pick up after himself. Next thing I hear, he is calling for me from our family room and tells me our sun conure is ""sick"". When I get to the birdcage I see that our bird is lying on the top of the cage, bleeding from his nose, and clearly struggling to breathe. I ask my brother what happened and he tells me the bird ""fell from his cage"". I call desperately for my mom and she tells me he is dying. The next two minutes are complete agony as I watch my bird, *who has been one of my best friends for the last 11 years*, die by suffocating on his blood. At this point I'm in tears, and I ask my brother exactly what happened since there is no way falling from his cage would have caused such severe injuries. He finally confesses that he smacked the bird with a towel. There was no point in asking 'why' since he does this kind of stuff all the time.

Our dilemma:

My family and I don't know what to do with our brother anymore. He is an angry middle schooler and has a history of being somewhat violent (i.e., throwing books at his classmates for making fun of him), but this is an entirely new low for him. He has talked to the school counselor and has had regular sessions with a therapist, but I feel they are useless. His counselors have always given him the benefit of the doubt and held us responsible for his behavior. This troubles me as it removes any responsibility or sense of remorse for his actions. Case in point, when my mom talked to him about what he did he said that ""it wasn't his fault he inherited his dad's temper"". My bird did not deserve to die this way, and I fear that his anger problem could get worse. I will continue to follow his counselors advice and try to understand him, but it's difficult when he rejects advice and gets visibly frustrated when my mom or dad talk to him.

He begged and cried but I did not give in as much as I wanted to. Now a year later I am in a great relationship and love him to bits but by my own foolishness I reinstated my facebook and looked my ex up.

I almost started crying and wanted to punch something, I blocked him immediately so I couldn't snoop anymore and closed my laptop. 

Now he would not add me on fb when we dated and of course I know he never really cared for me because of all the now obvious signs. What I don't get is why this hurt so much, it felt like someone punched me right in the chest. It's been a year since we broke up, I have an amazing boyfriend (who actually lets me call him that.)
 
I've been thinking back and about a month ago he texted me out of the blue saying he had dreamed about me and wanted to know how I was (wtf.) He is a complete jerk and I am glad we are no longer together and as I am writing this the hurt and need I felt to cry are subsiding.

Let's jump right in. I kissed this girl at a party a week ago. I really fancied her and the day before I really made clear at another party that I liked her. It was the first kiss for both of us, bit misplaced it felt like but it was alright. Before the kiss there was a bit of flirting and we were becoming pretty close friends.

Do I want a relationship with her? I feel like that asking myself that automatically gives an answer (that I do not). She has send signals that she wants to date a bit. So I asked her to do so, but also mainly because friends are pushing me to.  I don't feel like I love her, and don't really know if I have to. Maybe that is supposed to come with the dating. I am new to all this and don't really know how relationships work. Also I am having fear of commitment (I think), this because I have had a rough time with losing people around me that I have loved so dearly. Maybe it is not the right time for me to get into a relationship if I am having these issues. 

All in all I am a bit confused, don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her feelings and also don't want her out of my life.

TITLE: My [20F] boyfriend [21M] likes to piss me off?
POST: So I'm currently pregnant so its possible I'm reading too much into this but he seems to enjoy making me angry? For example, today we were talking and his best friend has recently started dating a girl that he has a history with. Even though she is dating his friend and we're about to have a baby she is still over him and has tried to hook up with him in the past months. He's told her no but it hasn't stopped her from trying. Recently she's backed off a little and is trying to be more of a friend to him and he says that I need to just ""get over it and get along with her."" I don't start fights with her or yell at her I just refuse to be her friend or be around her as I have no desire to keep her company. He mentioned that she invited him to come to some child expo with her (while I'm at work) and he said he didn't want to go without me (for fear that she would try something). And I said that was probably for the best because it would've upset me if he went. Then he responded and said that made him want to go with her just to piss me off because I have no right to get upset. I don't understand why he would want to do something like that to intentionally hurt me. It wasn't like I lost it and ""forbid"" him from going,  I just said it would upset me. Am I overreacting and shouldn't have said that or is he just being an asshole because with my hormones I cant tell anymore.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my GF [21 M/F] of 5 months, says ""I love you"" to me, I feel bad cause I never say it back.
POST: My GF and I  have been dating for 5 months now. We were friends for a few months before that. Initially she got a crush on me, and asked me out. The first month or two we dated, our relationship wasn't that great tbh. Mainly because I didn't treat her like a girlfriend. I'd leave and go home after we fucked, showed up over an hour late to our first date, ditch her during out hangouts to go get high with my friends, etc... we had some good times, but overall I felt nothing towards her so I was kind of an asshole. 

After some time though, I started to like her and act a lot better and more like her boyfriend and we started having even more fun, and she started to REALLY like me, I know cause she'd tell me that she ""really really really liked me"" multiple times, and that ""I was the best guy she ever dated"" 

Heres the thing though, she told me she ""loves me"" but she said that she wasn't ""in love"" with me. I didn't know how to react so I was just like ""ok"". But now she always says ""I love you"" before we go to sleep, or I leave or something. 

I never say it back because I still only kinda like her, I'm no where close to feeling like I love her or being able to say it back to her, and honestly, I feel kinda bad about it. I'm afraid that she expects me to say it back sometime soon, and I know that its not gonna come for a while, and I don't wanna hurt her, but everytime she says it I  just kiss her or awkwardly nod my head....how should I handle this? Do you think I should tell her to stop saying it to me until I feel I'm ready to say it back, or should I just keep doing what I'm doing?

TITLE: TIFU by breaking up with the best thing that's ever happened to me.
POST: My boyfriend cheated on me a couple months ago and I found out right before Christmas. We had an unspoken break up and I thought that was the end of it. 

Last Thursday we both ended up at the same bar where he ended up getting in a fight with a boy for touching me in a way that bothered him. I got scared and embarrassed so I left. A couple hours later he found his way back to my dorm where he cried to me and poured his heart out. We spent the next 4 hours together crying until we fell asleep. And i decided to give him a second chance. 

This past Thursday I went to a party with my cousin where I watched her cheat on her boyfriend that she claims to be in love with. This sent me over the edge and my drunk mind decided that if she was capable of cheating then I can't trust anybody. Stupid I know. So I went home and called my boyfriend over at 2am and ended it. I told him I wasn't mad and he didn't do anything wrong. It was a very civil break up and we spent about 2 hours just talking and joking around like we always did. 

Now I regret that decision more than anything. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I've just been drinking myself into a coma every night since then. I keep trying to text him but he won't answer. I know I hurt him, but I think I hurt myself even more.

The thing is, he has basically become my unwelcome ""guardian angel."" For example, the other night we were at a bar with a group of our friends, and any time I started to talk to a guy he was right there, including when I would go outside for a cigarette with another guy (he doesn't smoke). This happened throughout the night, and has happened at other bar outings. 

He's a very kind guy, if a bit socially clueless sometimes, so I don't think it's malicious. I also know that I need to talk to him, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to handle this tactfully and without making him feel bad. What should I say to him?

The problem that I have been experiencing is this: my brain is constantly switching between dreams, and each one feels as genuine and real as the other. I don't have 10 lifetimes to try them all, especially since I believe in the virtues of passion and mastery and focus. All these videos and quotes promote a simple (and excellent) message of doing what you love and working insanely hard at it.

Perhaps it's because of the constant exposure to new information and ideas (TED Talks, twitter, etc.) and inspirational videos from a wide variety of people, but I keep beating myself up trying to figure out what to focus on and it's starting to drive me crazy.

* Teach
* Learn to code.
* Promote childhood learning of programming.
* Learning Japanese
* Hone my skills at drawing.
* Getting in shape. Learning a martial art.
* Make video games that push forward the medium.
* Improving education in the deep south where I grew up.
* Become and animator or storyboard artist for Pixar.
* Get involved in technology that helps humanity.

to name a few...

Can anyone else relate to this? Passion and motivation are not the issue for me, it's the feeling of an enormous amount of different options, and so I keep running through this loop of thought:

* I don't want to spend my life sitting at a computer, I want to use my body and encourage others to use their bodies and form real human connections.

* Physical fitness only effects me, and technology and sociology is where it's at for helping the world.

The main problem at this point, is that even though there's enough room in bed for the 3 of us, my wife and I don't sleep as well because of partner disturbance, and having to be extra careful not to disturb our precious time bomb. I've ended up sleeping on a spare bed outside of the room. We know we need to get her to sleep alone in her crib, but every time we try, it results in sleepless nights for all 3 of us, and by 3 or 4 in the morning, the little one ends up in bed anyway.

We've had suggestions to put the crib in a different room, let her cry and fuss, and we're willing to try that, but I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar circumstance and could offer some advice.

TITLE: I don't know how to achieve my financial goals. Please advise...
POST: Hey there r/personalfinance! 

I'm a 32 M with an associate's degree working as a server in an upscale restaurant. I just started about a month ago and it's a really great gig and I feel I'm getting really good at it, but I'm only pulling down about $250 a week because summer is our slow season. My co-workers tell me that from October to May I can expect about $500 - $800 per week depending on the shifts I get. I'm also eligible for the company 401k starting in October. 

After some thought I've realized that a long term goal I have is to move back to my home town, or a town like the one I grew up in. Problem is, houses in that area go for anywhere between 350 - 750k (right up to a million). I don't really want to get into managing a restaurant because I don't like the work load/salary trade off. I'm willing to work my butt off, but I don't know if the service industry fits my 5-10 year goals. 

What's more so, I am completely debt free and hesitant to go back to school unless it's for something considered a pretty safe bet. I don't have a lot of people in my life who are older and wiser than me, and so I'm not sure how to plan out my next career move. I was thinking about saving money and heading back to community college, but I have no idea what for. 

I guess I'm posting this because I'm hoping to find someone who has been in a similar situation and come out the other side. I want to start looking for professionals to network with in my community to get input and contacts, but again, I don't really know how. Has anyone here done something similar to what I'm trying to do? Again, I'm willing to work hard for a few years to achieve my goals, I just don't want to compound my issues with student debt if I don't have to.

I should mention I also have retail management experience and I am planning on being functionally fluent in Spanish by December. 

Any advice is truly appreciated. Thanks!

TITLE: How much to keep liquid for grad school?
POST: I am applying to grad school for fall 2016 and I want to make sure I am being as smart with my money as possible. 

Right now I currently have about $30k sitting in my savings account, (I know, I know, that's why I'm here asking!) about $7k in Vanguard index funds that I contribute ~$1000 to over the course of each year, and I just became eligible to get matching contributions to my 403(b) at my job. (They match 5% if I contribute 3% or more)

I've wanted to keep a lot of my funds liquid because I'm not sure what the future will hold. Ideally I will get into a fully funded phd program and get a 25k/year or so stipend, but there is a chance I will do an in-state not-funded masters first. I still have enough in my college fund to cover the pretty inexpensive in-state tuition for 4 semesters, but I would either have to have enough savings to live on for 2 years, or take out loans. 

So now the question is how much I should contribute to the 403(b). On one hand, I could max it out ($16,500) and not feel a thing even though I only make 30k pretax at that job, because I could just start supplementing my significantly reduced paycheck with savings. Or I could throw in like 5-7k just to get retirement savings started, but still keep more liquid. When I go to grad school, I can either keep it in the 403(b) or roll it over to an IRA.

I know having 30k in savings is not the best use of that money, but will the compound interest on putting a big chunk of it in the 403(b) outweigh potentially having to take out loans for grad school?

I will generally grow to like anything over time with frequent exposure, when I was younger for example I liked Pokemon Blue because Red was an ugly colour, and I would generally only like the ""flawless"" actor/resse/s, but with time I would now choose Red, and I think [Toby Kebbel] is a very handsome looking dude.

If it exists, is there a name for it? While I imagine there's parallels between this and whatever the whole ""indiescenealternative"" stuff that cycles around, it's not like that, I sound biased because I openly hate that whole thing, but in a way that's too intense to actually like it for that reason.

Smart, sexy, career driven, etc. My friends are all super jealous and my parents and sister love her and the feeling is mutual with her family.

But 6 months and still no sex. She gives me oral though but our relationship lacks that crazy passion and I am constantly tempted to cheat not because I don't love her but because what I want she is not willing to give (at least not in the last 6 months).

POST: I've been on the fence about this but have decided its something I have to do.

We have discussed most of our issues to some length over the past year or so but I don't believe she finds them as problematic as I do.

This will be the first serious relationship I will have to end and don't really know how to go about it. Particularly before and after (i have a fair idea of what I should say during). I'm unsure how to handle the ""before"" because I don't think she will have much warning I do t want it to be a surprise bit at the same time I feel our relationship should be indicative of itself but my friends and family have told me they don't think she will see it coming at all. The ""after"" I think is tricky because we met in university and she didn't have any close friends until I pulled her in to my group of friends, when I leave I believe they will all take my side and she'll have no one. I also don't know what to do in terms of no contact.

I still care about her a great deal and want this to go as smooth as possible.

Issues: (you can skip this if its unnecessary I know its getting lengthy)

She wants to get married and start a family asap... And I want to focus on my career and getting my life on track, I'm not sure if we're even right together to be married. sometimes I think she's so set on getting married it blinds her to our relationship issues. As far as my career goes I plan to open my own engineering firm and this takes a lot of capital which I don't think could be feasible with the lifestyle she wants.

She is very argumentative, little things normally, I pick my battles but lately I haven't had the patience.

Our sex drives are polar opposites, basically the passion has been gone for over a year now and she only does it to placate me... Which is not so much emasculating as it is infuriating.

(called me from another phone) I found it, and saw she had a few messages on it. I assumed these to be from her texting her phone to find it, so i opened her phone to reply. 

The phone opened upon messages of her and her boyfriend, and long story short, they implied that they have been having sex. 

I realize it's her body, her relationship, and probably NONE of my business to have snooped and found this out. But I love my sister, and I have a few concerns. One of them being, I feel like my mother should know about this. My mom has always told us if we ever did decide to do anything like this, to come to her. My mom is super supportive and loves us both dearly. Also, my sister is still living in their house, so I feel like their rules also still apply. 

I know my mom would want my sister to be safe, and would want to know about this. I am a bit torn. I love my sister very much and really want to let her know that I am here for her if she needs to talk about anything. 

I believe my sister is on BC ( for acne/period related reasons). This is her first and only boyfriend. I just want to make sure she knows the risks and is being safe. How should I approach this to minimize damage in any relationships? Should I just pretend I never saw this?
TL;DR: ",A woman accidentally found out her sister is sexually active and is unsure if she should tell their religious mother. She wants to ensure her sister is safe but doesn't want to damage their relationship.

TITLE: Hospital Bills, they keep sending me new bills and charges.  Am I actually legally responsible?
POST: Hey lawyers and legal experts of reddit,

So basically my child had a surgery on an ankle, I got an estimate for my portion of the procedure for $900.  Obviously physicians orders and actual operating time can adjust that and they came back with $1000 actual cost.  After setting up a payment plan with them I received a new bill with an additional amount charged and even a bill from a separate group for Anesthesia. My insurance company keeps paying part of these charges. ***Am I liable to pay an adjusted bill after all the costs were already calculated and billed?***  I have a feeling that because the hospital is the only one for children and they must take uninsured patients they realized that I have insurance and money so they are trying to squeeze out the most of it.  Please help me!

So I stayed the night at my boyfriend's last night and woke up this morning with the great idea of going to the bakery for breakfast. I wanted to be cute and surprise him with donuts before he woke up.

Well, I ended up leaving and coming back within 20 minutes. When I got back to his place, I went to the bedroom to wake him up and that's when I walked in on him. He had his laptop open and was masturbating to a bikini pic of me from this summer. Needless to say, he was extremely embarrassed and wouldn't even look at me when we were eating breakfast. lol.

I feel bad. I told him it was totally fine, but things have been a little awkward today. Has anyone else gone through this before? What can I do to fix this?

POST: I feel really, really sad when I'm single. And over the moon happy when I'm in love and have a boyfriend. 

Now that I'm single (it's been about 7 weeks), I find myself crying almost everyday. I've been forcing myself to go out and be social but ONLY because I'm hoping to meet someone. Friendships just do not give me the joy that a romantic partner does.

I like time with my family too (and I'm very close with my mom, see her a lot), but I'm just so badly seeking a BF, and feel super lonely and sad when I don't have one.

I workout in a group fitness class 3 times a week in the mornings before work. I thought that would keep me happy, but it hasn't. I keep busy. I just... want a bf so badly, and feel very sad without one... and even if I occupy free time with friends and social activities, I go back home feeling sad because I don't have a SO.

POST: After coming out of a long-term relationship I thought I would try and get myself back in the game.

A friend recommended Tinder, so I thought why not? Ended up matching with a girl about half an hour away and we hit it off really well. We've got a lot in common in terms of music tastes and travelling and the like.

After talking for two weeks in Tinder she gave me her number and we've continued to speak via text message.

She has told me that she would like to meet up and we've been flirting on and off too. She said the other night that if she didn't want to speak to me she wouldn't and that I'm now stuck with her. I told her she wouldn't be a bad person to be stuck with, and she said I'm not too bad myself - the standard lines etc.

How can I get a meet up locked down. We've said a couple of times that we would like to meet up but haven't organised anything yet - even just for a drink or something like that. She works 13 hour shifts three days a week and I work 9-5 monday to friday.

Do I leave her to make the move and suggest a proper time to meet up, or do I keep making the suggestion?

TITLE: Should I (35/F) distance myself from a friend (35/M) I have a crush on?
POST: Throwaway because my husband knows my username. I'm pretty sure I'm over thinking this situation but thought some outside opinions would be useful. 

I've been friends with Eric since high school. He's a genuinely great person. We have always just kind of clicked, our first couple of years in college in particular he was one of my best friends. I always had a HUGE crush on him, but he always had a girlfriend so I never acted on it. Crush feels kind of inadequate describing it to be honest, I think I was as close to being in love with him as you can be with someone you don't actually have a romantic relationship with. After college I moved out of state and we lost touch, I met my husband and we have been together almost 10 years and have three kids. We have a wonderful relationship. 

About a year ago we moved back to my hometown together and I've gradually started reconnecting with some high school friends, including Eric. He is married now and we double date and all have a great time together. He has a lot in common with my husband, including some hobbies that I don't share with them, so they are starting to form a genuine friendship outside of my friendship with him. 

The problem I'm having is that when I hang out with Eric I still feel like I have a crush on him. We just get along so well, we didn't talk for 8 years but have been able to pick right back up when we left off. I feel guilty about this sometimes, like it's disrespectful to my husband (although nothing remotely inappropriate has ever happened, I would never risk my relationship with my husband). I am a little worried that talking to my husband about it might make it awkward between him and Eric, and I would hate for him to lose a potential friend when he just moved across the country with me and doesn't know many people here yet. So…am I over thinking all of this? I know crushes happen but I can't help but wonder if maybe I should try to distance myself from Eric and just encourage my husband to go out and do stuff with him without me. Or should I talk to my husband and let him decide?

TITLE: How do you regain someone's trust?
POST: Ok, so I have a friend (she's one of my friends, actually!) who's parents are kind of strict, she especially IS NOT allowed to have one sip of an energy drink (it will make sense later, as I tell the story). One day she had a get together with me and to other girls and I brought a monster so I could stay up later. After I drunk most of it I put it in my friends mini fridge and forgot about it, the next morning her dad found it. (I wasn't there when he found it, so I don't know the exact reaction he had) My friend said that he literally interrogated her until she told him who had brought it. That was my first mistake, and apparently her parents weren't really that mad since I never even gave her a sip of it. But the next time I went over there I borrowed her iPad to go on reddit and accidentally forgot to log out. Her mom used it the next day and went through the account (not even knowing what Reddit was) and saw me using some not so ""appropriate"" words (no cussing AT ALL at her house, her parents are especially strict about that rule). She ""interrogated"" my friend again about who's account it was. Also, one of the things i posted was a rage comic about her from over the summer and her mom saw that too, so her mom was extremely POed about me talking about her like that (we had a HUUUUGE dissagrement over the summer, but we have become really good friends since then). I know what I did was wrong but now my friend's parents said that I'm not allowed to hang out for a looooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnngggg time, and defiantly not until next year(they never said that to me, they said that to my friend)!

TITLE: EX Wife hates my current partner - we have kids and it's becoming a problem
POST: I'm 28 and my ex wife is 29. We were married for 4 years (together 6) before splitting up over 18 months ago, we also have 2 gorgeous girls (aged 5 and 3). Things were really messy during our split but have settled down. Neither of us were particularly happy in the marriage and it just exploded. I feel like we're both happier people now and we actually get along and have a laugh and can share special events with the kids (birthdays/random beach outings etc) - it's really nice.

Problem is I've been seeing someone for the last 6 months or so, and she is someone my ex-wife was friends with in highschool but fell out with not long afterwards.  This is causing huge problems as my ex wife does not want her around our children, or to even meet her again or have her at events. My new SO has 2 children of her own as well around the same age so it makes things hard when they are excluded from events with my children. The way my ex wife was during our breakup (she lost the plot, used the kids as ammo etc) makes me cautious about how to approach this, but I'm really at a loss as to what to do. It would be nice if we could all hang out and get along (ex wife has been seeing someone as well) but I know that will never happen as my ex wife hates this person.  I'm not asking for us to be one big happy family but it would be nice if we could all just get along. She's even said ""if it was anyone else I wouldn't have a problem with it.""

I'm not about to give into my ex wifes demands here, but I hate that this may turn into a huge problem in the future. Do I tell my ex wife to stick it, or just suck it up and realise it will always be this way?

TITLE: TIFU by driving home from school [NSFWish]
POST: This happened about 15 mins ago, and it was such a terrible experience I feel the need to share it. Throwaway because real life.

So I was driving home from school on one of the busy streets in my city when I noticed my balls were stuck to the inside of my leg. Driving in this position is FUCKING AWFUL,  because every time you change pedals you run the risk of pinching a nut. 

Being the daft mother fucker that I am, I thought to myself, 'hey! I can just reach in my pants, unstick myself, and no one around me will have any clue about what I've done!'

So I commenced my grand scheme at a particularly long red light. I was in the left lane and the lane to my right was sailing by. No one would even notice. And if anyone pulled up next to me, they wouldn't be able to see in. 

I reached in my pants and unstuck my sac from the inside of my leg. However, while I was down there I realized that I had to scratch. So I began scratching. I started scratching like my life depended on it.

This is when I fucked up.

I looked up and to my right to realize that the righthand lane had come to a halt. This wouldn't have been a problem had the car that stopped next to me been a honda or some small vehicle. But that wasn't the case. What stopped next to me was a FUCKING BUS. This bus' angle let everyone on the left side of the bus to see into my car. 

I looked up and made eye contact with probably one of the most attractive females I'd ever seen, hands still in my pants. I stopped my scratching and pulled my hand out.

She just looked at me with this look. One I will never forget. One that said, 'WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU.'

I wanted to leave. I waned to get the fuck out of there so bad. But my light was still red. So I had to sit there, music playing and this girl staring at me like I was some sort of pervert.

TITLE: Me [18 M] asking a girl [17 F] I never officially met out on a date
POST: Note: I have never been in a relationship nor have I ever made an attempt to ask someone out.

For the past few months I have been picking up my brother [17 M] from school almost everyday. Occasionally, people would ask for rides or my brother would offer rides. There have been few times when a have given a ride to two girls. The first girl I have met in the past in high school, let's call her ""Jenny"". The second girl, let's call her ""Nicole"", and I never met previously and we have not been introduced to each other. Jenny and Nicole are best friends and every time I gave them a ride I always dropped them both off at Jenny's house, as requested.

I think Nicole is very beautiful and I find myself attracted to her. I do plan on asking her out, but in this situation I do not know whether I should just get straight to the point or if I should take small steps.

Here is the plan I had previously thought of: When I drop them off at Jenny's house I will let them take a few steps towards the house before I get out of the car and interrupt them. I call out to Nicole ""Hey, wait! Nicole, right? I know this may be a little strange since we barely know each other but, (complement about how I think she is pretty) and I would like to take you out on a date sometime"".

My previous thoughts was that it is completely normal for two complete strangers going out on a date. But recently I have been thinking more about it and I started considering finding a way for a group of us (me, Jenny, Nicole, and couple of their friends) to hangout as a way for Nicole and I to get to know each other.

POST: My girlfriend and I recently stopped living together after 1.5 years. We've been together a total of 2.

Things were great at the start until about 5 months in, where we started having problems. I had some old baggage that I had to resolve myself, so I started going to therapy and working things out. She threatened to move out because of my problems, and actually did for a few days, but came back. We resolved our problems, but they arose again a year later (about a month ago). Not the same problems, but this time it was some problems she was having. The household became really toxic and she decided that she didn't want us to live together anymore. I pleaded for her to stay and work on it together as a family, but she decided that we should live apart and work on ourselves.

We've been living apart for about 2 weeks now, but I haven't seen her at all since she went on a family trip. She's back now and wants us to ""work on our relationship."" I'm wondering if I should even bother because I feel a sense of resentment toward her for breaking us up (in terms of our living situation.) I also don't feel like I can trust her - I look toward the future and imagine us having kids, going through a difficult time, and then her deciding to break our family apart again.

We broke up for a little bit and got back together when I was 17 and our relationship was legal. We both had infidelities and he decided it was best we broke up at the end of 2009. I was devastated, heartbroken. Wanted another chance... We went no contact until 2011 when we hooked up once and we mutually went back to no contact.

Then in January 2013 we start seeing each other again. He wanted it to be a secret from any mutual friends and I agreed. After almost a year I told him I couldn't take it anymore because we were living a lie and we broke the news to our friends, apologized for hiding it so long. He started telling me he loved me again in July of last year. I was so happy to finally have my first love back... 

Well our relationship has never been all that great. He holds the past against me, accuses me of cheating and lying constantly. We're both extremely jealous and our relationship was toxic from the beginning. None the less this man, no matter what he says or does has my unconditional love.

Right now we are broken up and have been for a little over a week now but have talked nearly everyday. He broke up with me because he didn't want a closed relationship with me and I wasn't willing to open it. Now I wish I would have agreed because we're broken up and I still plan on continuing our sexual relationship once a week...

TITLE: :( My [27 M] ex-girlfriend [29 F] broke up with me. Post-breakup behaviour is odd. WOULD LIKE ADVICE
POST: So my girlfriend and I called it quits a little under 2 weeks ago. Big fight in public with her rehashing things from the past. In the end it broke down to communication issues, nothing particularly harmful that was done to one another. She said it's not longer worth the fight and wanted to break up. I disagreed a few times and tried to get her to change her mind, but she didn't and so I simply caved and agreed. We parted ways and that was that.

Last week she was supposed to attend a meeting for a group that we are both a part of. Even during the break up, she said that she would see me at the meeting and we need to be civil in order to avoid awkwardness. I agreed, and told her I have no problem with civility and being professional in such a setting. Anyway, she no-showed.

I left a note on her desk, basically saying that I couldn't help but notice her absence and that I hope she's getting some much needed rest after working hard the last few weeks. Nothing mushy, simply caring. I wasn't expecting a reply; I actually prepared myself for the silent treatment. As I suspected, she ignored it completely.

Ever since the break-up however, she's posted multiple quotes or ""quotestagrams"" on her social media. My news feed constantly pops up with quotes she's liked. Each about relationships and more bitter than the next. A lot of them are direct responses to issues we had. I'm definitely not reading into them, there's no such thing as that much of a coincidence.

I'd like to understand why this is being done. If breaking up was her idea and she said she was 100% sure that it's no longer worth the fight, then why keep posting and liking these things to get my attention? Is it simply to get my attention? Or is she actually hurt? I don't understand how someone can be so bitter over something they wanted themselves. On top of that, why not just reach out to me like I reached out with a simple caring note on her desk?

TITLE: Did I screw up my FAFSA by supplying half my parents joint income for my separated mother?
POST: I'm currently a high-school senior, and am planning on attending a four year university this fall. I am worried I might have made a mistake submitting my FAFSA. 

Context: My parents are separated but not legally divorced, hence, although living pretty-much separate lives, they still file taxes jointly. I live with my mom, who has been my primary source of financial support since my parents separated. She makes less than half of what my father makes.

When filling out my fafsa, I was unsure how to handle this situation, but after researching online, it seemed that every source I could find (except for official government sites, which were silent on the issue) said the same thing: I should just report one parents income, unless I live in a community property state (which I do, Texas), in which case I should report half of the joint income. This was exactly what I did. In hindsight, I realize I should have checked with a counselor or something before submitting.

Today, I was contacted by my school's automated system, and they want me to submit verification of the information I entered. I'm realizing now that if I was mistaken about how to fill out the FAFSA in my situation, halving all the information from my parents tax returns might look like fraud, particularly given that I won't have the opportunity to explain what I did. 

With this is in mind I have two questions:

1. Did I screw up when submitting my fafsa?

2. When I submit my parents' tax return for verification will I get in trouble with the school and/or the federal government? If so, is there anything I could do to prevent this, by say, forfeiting federal aid?

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply.

TITLE: Is it a normal thing for me (F23) and my best friend (M27) to sleep in the same bed all the time?
POST: Does anyone else have a *platonic* friend that they stay and sleep with? He and I are very close and almost instantly became that way about a year ago. To the point that people don't understand why we aren't dating. While we do spend a lot of time together, we've never crossed into that romantic plane. We've discussed the issue, but neither of us have ever made a move. We've also been involved with other people on a somewhat casual level. However, despite that fact, I have drunkenly suggested that we cross the line and recently spewed to him that *maybe everyone else was right and we should be together and that he should kiss me*. He didn't. He told me that since I was drunk that I'd regret it the next day. Well, I felt like an ass. I also felt that things would be awkward, he didn't allow that though. And we're still staying with each other. I'm having a very hard time figuring out/accepting that I have those sort of feelings for him, especially considering that he may not return those feelings. He did say though that he had a hundred things going through his head when it came to his past love, his current crush, and myself. I think we both need to just sort things out, but back to my main question, are we really that peculiar in how close we are or are there other people out there with friendships like ours?

She's started to go to 12-step meetings for Sex/Love addicts, which is sort of a surprise to me, as I didn't really see this.

My wife and I have had to overcome a lot of issues, I myself am a recovering alcoholic, sober for 8 years.  

I am really struggling with this, though.  In all the time we've been together, no matter what, I have never been worried about her cheating.  We have our problems, but I have always felt that at least I could trust her in this area.  Now I feel like I can't, and I don't know really how to process this.

POST: I don't know why I do this, but I always have sense a young age. Sometimes when I'm at my lowest, I tend to start thinking really hyperbolic and dramatic. Ie: Calling myself worthless, a loser, etc. Or doing something small and start texting shit like ""Omg. I'm sorry. Are we cool?

None of my friends have ""written me off"" persay. Like if I reach out to them, they tend to reply most of the time. However, I don't get invited to social events with them anymore. And I miss that. I'm really introverted/awkward/etc and I have a hard time making friends. So the friends I do have I like to cherish and keep a hold. But I feel like since the bridge isn't 100% burned, I can build it back somehow. I just don't know how to gain the trust back. Any ideas?

TITLE: Reddit, how can I address Congress in person?
POST: Recent events have led me to believe that no matter what America says, Congress will not listen. My belief is they are far too busy acting like toddlers to give a single shit about anything that doesn't advance their personal agenda (what with the endless name-calling and blatant sabotage of anything ""the other side"" proposes), and are consequently damaging the country beyond repair. 

Every day I hear or see something in the news that actually makes me feel physically sick with frustration. Statistics show I'm not alone in my frustration, but the powers that be seem to be a tad out of touch with the feelings of the general population. 

Everybody is sick of Washington's bullshit, and I think it's time somebody marched into the House of Representatives and told our public servants to, essentially, stop being a bag of dicks (perhaps with slightly more eloquent phrasing). 

So my question to you is, how do I go about telling Congress to get its act together right to its slimy, slimy, slimy face, preferably without being shot in the face by security in the process? I feel as though bursting into the chamber and asking, as somebody who helps pay all of their salaries, to use the podium is the best way to draw attention to what I have to say, but (and please correct me if I'm wrong) I'm thinking that waltzing into important federal buildings and making demands is not the best way to go about this.

TITLE: /relationships said this belongs here
POST: I've been dating the same girl for about a year and a half. At this point, I can still say truthfully that I love her, but we have been distant, in part because she is finishing up her last year(ish) of school, and I am already working in the city. We see each other once every 2-3 weeks.

However, there is another girl at my work who I have known for some time, that I am starting to develop feelings for, although I have never cheated on my gf with her.
Here is the kicker. My gf is going to study abroad for her final semester (4 months), and the non gf ""friend"" is moving away in August.

I feel like I am losing some very important people in my life, and there is nothing I can do. I really feel like I can't tell either girl the extent of the situation, because then I risk losing them both entirely.
Another issue is my pot use. I find that it helps with my depression, which I think is in part caused by the fairly consistent lack of female contact, and no means to get it without cheating. I normally like smoking, but I want to save the money instead.

I've told my gf that I need a break this fall, as I can't do 4-5 months of NO female contact whatsoever. She was upset, but asked if we could still keep in contact and I was thrilled and said of course.
I just feel really confused. Just typing this sort of helped, but I'm scared that I am going to lose people I care about.

POST: Hello friends! It's been a long while since I posted. About a year ago, I was just starting my weight loss lifestyle change and going strong, only to be slightly derailed around last Christmas.  
 
At 90+ pounds lost so far and still more to go, I'm getting back into the game hardcore mode. I had not too long ago stopped counting calories and just mentally tallying, but I'm pretty sure I am a big fat fibber to myself when it comes to portions, so no more of that. In addition, despite my legs' protests, I am starting the C25k program (well, a variation of it) at home in addition to running the same variant on the track at my gym. 

My question is, as the title hints, would running on the track be better for calorie burning than the elliptical, or should I do both (such as elliptical at the gym, running at home)? I understand the importance of cross-training, although elliptical running isn't very different imo from the track, but ""free"" running is far more taxing on me and I feel as if I get a better workout than on the elliptical. The only real exception I guess is that I do intervals while free-running, and I'm at a constant speed (most likely higher than my average running/walking track speed) on the elliptical. So what do you think?

POST: Hi, everyone. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months. We are both at the same college, but are currently apart for summer. We skype often. Our relationship is fantastic, and we both love each other a lot. This is just one aspect that I believe I need to work on. I have spoken to him about it, and he wasn't clear--but I think the gist was that hopefully it will fade over time.

The issue is whenever we get into an argument--a real argument or a conversational debate--I feel slightly attacked. And, I become defensive. I, then, start thinking about some of the not-so-nice things that he has done. Whenever he has done or said something that has hurt me, it has always truly been unintentional or him just being slightly callous towards my feelings. I think of things that I have forgiven him for, but it makes me upset to think of those situations.

I know this is wholly unfair to him. If we are discussing a topic where we have opposing opinions, I can't start thinking about a douche move pulled a few months back. 

I don't know how to get myself to stop feeling this way. And, I really do want to be able to have spirited discussions with him! How can I stop doing this?

POST: Hi Reddit,

so a few days back i met a beatiful girl on a seminar i was on. We liked each other from the beginning and started to talk a lot during the 5 days we were there. I really liked her from the beginning and know i just can't stop thinking about her. She seems to be perfect for me. We have the same hobbies, love the same music etc. . I will also meet her again in a few days and just knowing that makes me so happy. I would really be the luckiest person on this planet and in the entire galaxy if she would be my gf but the problem about this is that she is in a relationship with her boyfriend for nearly 2 years which makes everything so difficult.

During the seminar we were on it also came to a moment when we were tickling each other a bit and then our foreheads touched. We looked us both in the eyes for a couple of seconds but I didn't know what to do. I would have maybe gone for a kiss there if she wouldn't have been in a relationship. But most of the time we spent together or with the people we liked. We also sang Karaoke together danced a bit and talked for like an hour about the problems we have/had. It felt like she is the one for me.

She even lives together with her bf since a few months which makes it even more difficult for me to date her or something like that. It seems to me that waiting for them to break-up is my only possible way to even get her to date me which makes me sad

POST: My girlfriend is cheery and happy whenever she's with me. She smiles, laughs and enjoys life to the fullest during our time together or when with her friends. 

She's recently lost her job (a job she enjoyed very much) and has been working part time at a coffee shop. I work 9-5 so during the days off, she's alone in the apartment and not doing much. This has been beating down on her for months especially because her friends are doing the jobs they love and being wildly successful. This resulted in a couple calls with crying on my lunch break or just breakdowns on her not going anywhere with her life. 

I'm trying my best to tell her we'll work on it together. She tells me that she's just gonna end up working a mediocre job that she doesn't love because she turned down or missed out on larger opportunities through the years. She didn't finish university and feels bad seeing her friends graduate as well. 

She had a couple chances to do really extravagant jobs through the years. Due to circumstances (parents preventing her, unwillingness to move to another country), she had to turn them down. There are more factors for why she turned them down but the fact that she missed out on them burns her deep.

I'm not sure where to start because she's normally so strong and seeing her this low and sad triggers me to try and help the best I can. I want to help her get a successful job she loves and get her happy again. I personally don't care much for extreme careers. I just like working and being paid a decent wage. But I want her to have a job she can be proud of. I just want to see her happy.

So, my girlfriend is feeling low and embarrassed over turning down possible dream jobs, not having a stable job at the moment, possibly working a mediocre job she wouldn't like and not finishing school. As her boyfriend, how do I help?

Since we moved in all that has stopped. Completely. It was as if a switch was flipped. I try to suggest things that we could do together and I cook and clean and give him massages and try to flirt with him to make him feel special but he never wants to do anything except smoke pot and play video games all day. (I should say I'm not against those things I don't smoke but I'm an avid gamer too but there's a point where it's too much!) I've tried and tried to explain that I don't feel wanted or desired by him anymore and he puts more effort in for a day or so and then nothing. I feel like I'm nagging and controlling to ask so often that it's driving me nuts!

It's gotten to the point where I'm not really sexually attracted to him anymore. I work out and I've tried to motivate him to go to the gym with me but he says his anxiety won't let him. I love him and I know it's shallow but he's put on so much weight since we moved in that I just... don't feel attracted to him. It also doesn't help that he won't try to romance me or put me in the mood and that's causing more tension for the both of us.

POST: I dated my best friend one an off for about 4 years. I was always the doting one in the relationship and he was generally emotionally unavailable, but I loved and cared for him deeply. After our last official break up we continued to spend all of our time together and occasionally hook-up, but it was really basic, unromantic sex. More than anything, i would call him my closest, dearest friend. 

After about 2 years of this, I met someone else and my Ex was devastated. He called and emailed all the time and all of a sudden wanted to be this caring, romantic boyfriend. But at that point, I only saw him as my best friend. This went on for 6 months (during which I was very caring, understanding and patient), until he met someone else. He wanted to break-off contact, which I understood completely. 

After about 2 months, I emailed him just to check in and he wrote back saying he missed me. 2 months after that, I called him (I shouldn't have, I know)--I knew he wouldn't pick up and I didn't leave a voicemail. He called back and left a voicemail that was unbelievably vitriolic and said,  among other things, that he said he never wanted to speak to me again.

That was 6 months ago, Reddit, and I'm still unbelievably upset. I don't know if it's just jealousy or a true longing, but I just miss my best friend so much. I can't get over it and I think about him every day. I would not, however, try to contact him again for fear of his response or lack thereof.

POST: I've been reading the many posts about SOPA on Reddit. I've also been reading the relatively few posts about McCain-Levin. I noticed that as SOPA has waxed and waned Redditors posted links about who to call, were giving updates on the volume of calls going into Congress about the bill, and giving blow-by-blow descriptions of how the fight was going.

McCain-Levin is potentially much more destructive to our civil liberties. It allows for indefinite military detention of Americans on American soil. If/when the bill takes effect, the government could declare Occupy a terrorist movement, like the UK has flirted with, and allow the military to lock folks up for as long as they like. This is much more devastating to our civil liberties than SOPA. It allows dictator-style ""disappearances"" and such. 

I am in my mid-40s, so I am a little older than many of you, but I am in the tech industry and I see a lot of young folks coming through. I do not buy into the things many older folks say about the youth being lazy, etc. I have a positive impression of the people coming out of college today. But I see the difference in response to these two bills, and I say WHAT? It makes me wonder if what I am hearing from the older generations is right: that the youth really only care about being able to pirate porn over the Internet and that the larger more important issues elude them. I don't want to believe this, but this situation makes me wonder.

So, the youth have proven themselves to be a force to reckon with in the SOPA debate and Occupy. Why did you not turn that power to do battle with the McCain-Levin bill, which challenges rights far more important than downloading LOTR from Pirate Bay.

POST: My contract with Vodafone Australia is nearly up, and I tried to upgrade my phone to a Samsung Galaxy S4. I called the necessary phone number to do the upgrade, and started speaking to a guy about what plans I could get it on.

I asked if I could remain on my current plan (The new ones are quite expensive) and the VF sales rep said that I could, and amazingly, the phone was turning up as $0 per month extra!
I happily accepted this offer, and the rep went through all the terms and conditions. I agreed to everything he said, and thanked him for the awesome deal.
The conversation ended and we both went on our happy ways.

About 45 minutes later however, the same rep called me back and said there was a mistake. I could not get the phone on my old plan for $0, it would be $35 p/m instead.

He also added that there was an extra charge of $270 left on my account (even though I was in my free upgrade period). There was a whole bunch of transfers between departments, and a lot of ""only that other department can answer that question.""

What I really want to know though, is whether the first agreement that we came to was (even though it might have been an error) legal and binding.

TITLE: Can I confront my employer about unfair pay/ discrimination? (Southern California)
POST: For the last three years I've been working for a small biotech company getting paid a really low wage. About six months ago I asked for a new position and to transfer departments (they needed help). My transfer was approved but I did not receive a raise. I thought huhhh, this is in no way a lateral transfer but I'll give it a few months, maybe I need to prove myself first. 

Over the past six months I had far exceeded my department director's expectations by developing a new product in addition to several other projects. My annual review was fantastic (5/5) and he recommended me for a ""significant"" raise. I asked for a 30% raise because that would place me on the low side of my new position's pay range. 

Now about a two months ago the small biotech company I'm working for was bought out by a huge biotech company. About a week ago I asked if my raise had been approved. It was not... surprise! I was told I asked for too much and that I might be able to get a 10% raise. Now in my opinion what I'm currently getting paid is a joke and I believe it to be unethical on this company's part. Based on my research (glassdoor & salary.com), I should be making $15,000 a year more than I'm currently making. I'm pretty certain this large biotech company pays that much or more for people with my job description. 

My question is what can I do? I'm a female and I live in CA. A new fair pay law recently passed that says females and males in similar roles need to be making similar wages.

POST: Okay so a little context here I have been dating my gf for 1.5 years now and we talk about everything. Last summer we attended a wedding of her cousin, which i'll call Shelly for this stories sake. Now Shelly and my gf are/were very close growing up and were best friends until Shelly went away for college. This is understandable as Shelly is a decent bit older.

When talking to my gf she stated that she was a little salty about the wedding itself as when they were younger Shelly promised her she would be in the bridal party due to how close they were. Come the wedding time she is told by her mom from the aunt (Shelly's mom) that there is going to be no bridal party just about S and her fiance. Normally only her family would have gone, but her younger sister was going to be on a trip to Europe so she would be more or less alone is terms of age group at the wedding. A few weeks before the wedding Shelly messages her on FB and tells her that she can bring a guest to the wedding if she would like, thats where I came in here. 

Once the wedding day itself comes and we are all seated we look up to the alter and what do you know three groomsmen and three bridesmaids. She didnt say much at the time towards it, but now has expressed her anger towards the situation to me in private. She feels like she is over it and being able to bring me was a compensation from Shelly for not having her in the bridal party. I told her I feel like she should tell Shelly how she feels/felt to get it off her chest and let her know that it wasnt right in her book and that she felt decently hurt by the lie/deceit that happened. Not saying she should atone for the actions in place, but at least apologize and talk out their feelings so there is no long term resentment from her.

She already has more guy friends than girl friends by far, but up until now they've all been very respectful of the fact that she and I are definitely in a relationship that's pretty rock solid.

The guy I'm worried about (we'll call him Jim) talks to her online constantly, and in one of their more recent conversations, he expressed his feelings for her. She rejected him outright, but he's still been talking to her a lot, telling her things about his life that most people wouldn't tell someone they met a month or so ago. (She told me all of this herself, by the way -- I didn't find out by checking her IM history or anything.)

I'm not worried that my girlfriend is going to be unfaithful, and Jim hasn't done anything to suggest that he might be unstable enough to try and force her into doing anything. Still, though, his (verbal) intimacy with her is putting me on edge. I don't like it.

I don't want to be the asshole boyfriend who chooses who his girlfriend can or cannot hang out with, but barring asking her to stop replying to his IMs, I'm not sure what to do in this situation.

TITLE: My girlfriend [19f] and I [20m] recently broke up and I'm not sure what to do.
POST: Never really done this type of thing before but I'm at my wits end with this situation and it's make me feel like shit.

My girlfriend [19f] and I [20m] recently broke up after 10 months because she felt that it wasn't like we were boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.

I've been feeling really stressed the past month or so and didn't really feel like I could talk to her and I'm imagining got a lot more distant than usual. I felt like I couldn't really talk to her as I'm her first boyfriend she would tell her friend about everything which I really wasn't comfortable with (and I couldn't just tell her to stop telling her friend anything).

I am in love with her although I haven't told her and I feel like we broke up for essentially nothing and it could have easily been avoided if we had just talked about it, at the time we broke up I was just too stunned to even really reply.

I really don't know if she feels the same about the situation as I do, I don't know if I should just talk about it because I don't want to ruin any chance of a friendship.

I am her first proper boyfriend so everything for her has pretty much been a 'first' and I felt that she didn't really know how to act in a relationship, this meant she talked to her friend a lot who really liked to meddle.

I really have no idea what to do and I really don't want to lose her, we were brilliant together and I'd really like for that to continue.

Does anyone have any advice for me?

TITLE: I (32F) am getting some unexpected money, would it be crazy/wrong to keep it from my husband (33M)?
POST: My husband and I have been together for 5 years, very happy together and we have no real financial issues. We disagree on stuff occasionally but always come to a resolution.

I am about to change jobs and just found out that my accrued vacation time is going to be paid out to me. The total is a little over $10,000. The money is totally unexpected, we keep a close eye on our budget and don't have any specific need for it.

The idea popped into my head to keep it a secret from my husband. Not for any negative reasons, I just like the idea of having a happy secret that I could surprise him with down the road. Maybe I could plan a surprise trip, or maybe we would get hit with an unhappy surprise bill down the road and I could say, ""surprise! I have money that can solve all of this for us!"" The idea would not be to hide it permanently, just until we need it for something or I can think of a great, fun way to use it.

Is this a terrible idea? It seems exciting and fun to me but I'm guessing not everyone sees it that way.

TITLE: Me [28 F] with my M [31 M] one night, married
POST: I met this guy at a bar and had the best night of my life with him. Things were more comfortable and amazing than anything I have ever experienced. After a crazy night with a lot of sex I left in the morning with no goodbye. Realizing shortly after I didn't want to just let this go, I went back to exchange contact information. When I went to do so I noticed he now had a wedding ring on his finger. I called him out on it and left in a rage.

Four days later I receive an email via social media from him - he had clearly taken the time to look me up as I did not supply any personal information. He voiced intense interest in me, his displeasure in his marriage and outright said I want to leave my wife. After a number of innocent messages were exchanged, where I explained my disgust and told him I was unwilling to be in any contact with someone who was married he implied he was going to leave his wife, asking me my feelings and how I felt towards him. I told him I was not going to reply to such a question as I did not want my actions or words to effect any decision he may or may not make.

I don't know what his decision will be, but I feel bad even thinking about him. I have never had such chemistry with anyone I've ever met, but I know it is an extremely fucked up situation. What do I do?

POST: Anyway, I don't like her. I don't need to go into any details. That's my opinion, and of course I have no justification to act on anything and I've never said anything about it. They've been dating for years and years now, and just got a place together. I think she genuinely makes him happy. She gets drunk and randomly slaps him sometimes, and I know you're all gonna scream abuse on this sub, but I dont see it as my problem either, and I've only seen it happen twice. He's a big boy and I believe he's handled it. 

Anyway, I miss just hanging out with my friend. I've noticed that as we get older, it's harder and harder to get friends to spend time away from girlfriends. I guess its mostly fine, since I am friendly with all the other girlfriends in our circle. I just don't like this one. This girlfriend generally has mixed relations within our circle. Some don't mind her, other feel like me.

How to deal? Miss my buddy quite a bit. We used to do lots of things together, but she's usually there when we hang out, and it would it, for me.

TITLE: Help! I pick broken relationships and I crave attention! How do I stop? (25f)
POST: I don't know why I keep putting myself through this... (25/female)

I was in an incredible 5 year relationship and my boyfriend left me for another girl completely out of no where. We talked about getting married and children so I was completely caught off guard by all of this. I honestly didn't have a very hard time getting over him because I know I deserve better than that and I would say I'm a pretty tough person (not manly, just not very emotional). 

Now 5 years later, I'm still single and can't manage to find/stay in a relationship. 
Every guy I meet I think they are going to leave me (even when things are great). And every relationship I'm in starts off really good and strong then completely crashes... I try everything in my power to keep the relationship going even when it isn't working. 

Currently, I've been seeing a guy (28) for 3 months. Technically we are FWB but we don't sleep with other people... We went from seeing each other 3 times a week and now I only see him once every 2 weeks (he's very busy) and I'm not cool with it, but I'm still stuck to him. The prior relationship, we were FWB for 10 month and I was crazy about him... Didn't work out because I moved out of the country temporarily, but we are still friends and I'm still crazy about him. What do I put up with this?

When I'm not in the presence of the person I'm dating I crave attention from other guys (not physical just talking and acknowledgment). I feel like I've developed a small attention whore persona in a way, I'm not loud and obnoxious in anyway, I just want the attention on me. I hate that I'm like this and I can't stop.

I don't know why I keep putting myself in these situations. Don't have the money to go to a therapist either :( I'm open to any questions or suggestions!
-Is there something I'm doing wrong?
-Is there a way I can get over this?
-Why do I keep doing this to myself when I know I deserve better?

 Since last week I've picked her up from her school 3 times and drove her home, she invited me inside all of those times, where we used to sit for 3-4 hours talking and giggling. I've met her parents, she told me that they liked me. Whenever I leave her house she gives me a hug.
 Everytime we talk, she stare deeply into my eyes, and so do I. I miss her whenever I'm not with her. My stomach is filled with butterflies, I really like her.

POST: We were together for 8 years. I met her in college. Some years were great and some years were bad. I broke up with her last summer because we  were arguing a lot and I decided we both deserved better. We had talked about getting married sometimes. I know she wanted to, and I did too, but I for some reason felt like I couldn't commit. 

It hurt for a long time. I thought the hurt would go away. But I still miss her and the more I think about it the more I realize I made a mistake and I think I was just running from commitment. Which sounds ridiculous now because we were together for so long, but I guess I was afraid of feeling trapped.

I have tried dating around. I thought a rebound girlfriend would help me. It did when I was younger. But every girl I'm with now just makes me think how little they are like my ex. And how much I miss her. And even though we fought a lot, how perfect we were. She always put up with me.

We don't talk any more but I know through friends that she misses me. She doesn't have a new boyfriend yet either. Should I try contacting her again? I really can't think of living my life with any other woman but her.

What do I do? If someone has gone through this can you please tell me what to do to fix this?

TITLE: TIFU by thinking a guy calling me was one of those annoying recording phone calls
POST: This actually happened a couple months ago, but I guess I forgot to write about it. It probably wasn't that bad of a fuck up, but I still feel like a complete asshole for it.

First a little back story: A few years ago I was visiting my family in the US (I grew up and live in Brazil), a woman fighting for gay rights on the street coerced me into registering myself and to make a donation. As a bisexual, I am all for gay rights, but I've never been a big fan of people on the streets just insisting on you to register and give them money, but since I am a push-over, it was exactly what I did.
Since I live in Brazil, I just gave my grandparent's address. Which was probably not the best idea since they are kinda homophobic.

Fast forward a year or so, and I am visiting my grandparents again. I am in a hurry to go out to do something, and the phone rings for me, which is odd since I don't live there.

I picked it up and hear a very electronic voice on the other side: ""Hi! We are calling you on behalf of the Gay Rights Blablabla Association to..."". I really really thought it was one of those recordings, and panicked because I didn't want my grandfather to find out, so I yelled out ""OH MY GOD!"" and immediately hung up.

My dad, who was the one who originally picked up the phone looked at me a bit surprised and just said: ""Why did you do that?"" and I explained him that I didn't want them calling me there because of my grandfather and stuff and I wasn't in the mood to deal with those electronic messages. He then told me it was actually a guy named Steve. I immediately felt like a complete asshole for doing so and could never call the number back and had no idea what the association's name was. 

So I am sorry for being an asshole Steve! If you are out there reading this, I am sorry! If anyone knows a Steve working for some kind of gay association, please tell him I am sorry!

Thank you for listening!

POST: I realise I might not be understanding something vital here.. but, as far as I know, people go out to mainly meet new people, and girls get all dressed up and stuff to find a potential mate.

Now, what if i'm dating this girl and we have cuddled and kissed and it's going all good, but she still goes out with her girls - all dressed up, has drinks.. and doesn't even text me once in the entire evening. I might be missing something here. Or I might be a drama queen or smth. It's just that I don't want to waist time on this girl, if she's not serious about me. 

As a guy, I see it being quite pointless to go out and do all of this, if there is already a person I'm in a relationship with. That makes me start thinking if I am not just the backup plan, while she is looking for someone better. I get mad just imagining this being the case! But at the same time, there might be other reasons why she does that.. like meeting new people or whatever.. but then again - you don't need to wear tiny skirts to meet new friends (which is what she did).

All I need is an objective view on this, because my judgement might be clouded by the emotions I'm feeling towards her.

I went almost immediately. When I got there, we hugged for 5 minutes or so, not saying anything. He looked so skinny. I asked him why he didn't call me and he said that ""he didn't want to bring me down.... like [he] always [does]"". I remember in one of the last conversations that we had, that I told him that I was too good for him, that he just brings me down. We were in the middle of a divorce, emotions were running high, but I guess he must have taken it to heart. He was really upset and crying. He was also on something, I assume morphine. After that he just kept asking me to go ""please go, please go."" Eventually he called the nurse, who came and asked me to leave.

I feel horrible and I don't know what to do. I didn't speak to his doctor because I was only there for 10 minutes, if that.

TITLE: Though I like where we are, I (26/f) don't want him (43/m) to get the wrong idea.
POST: I've been working with and playing music with him for a while now and we have recently started hanging out outside of music and work...more recently have gone out on a few dates. It's been great; we always have a great time, we've been keeping work and outside life separate, and it's been nice having him as a cuddle buddy (no, nothing more than that though kisses have been stolen).
The issue comes where last time that we were out he started giving me the googly eyes when I ""wasn't looking"" (not oogling eyes, but squishy-feels eyes), and I know that whatever this is has already negatively affected a friendship of his, misplaced jealousy being the cause. To top it off, I can feel my interest in him only growing. I just don't want anything to change. All in all, I know I'm not ready for anything like this to progress. I'm still struggling with some residual heartache and my life is in a transitional stage; I'm too distracted and can't afford the distractions. I really don't want to lose the projects we have going or the awkward date things. I just know my heart's not ready for anything of the sort *right now* and I don't want to tangle his heart strings because of my own bullshit.

TITLE: How long do you spend interested in someone for a relationship? When is the threshold to move on?
POST: Dear Reddit,

I'm currently an 18-year-old male with a developed interest in a girl for roughly two years now. We've went out a couple of times with groups of friends and alone as well and I've gotten to know her quite well. Amongst these events, there were subtle skinships and hints between us; at least to what I analyzed. Having graduated high school, some rough events happened between one of my friends and I, who didn't know we liked the same girl and shook the relationships, so I wasn't able to ask her out. This happened right before post-secondary education, as my interest and I separated ways to a three-hour time zone difference. We still chatted through means of technology, keeping in touch with each other as I sustained my attraction. Lately, this Christmas holiday, we got together again frequently and I've noticed that she's changed: becoming more shy, sensitive to touch and individualistic. Upon the beginning of the new term, I've found a time where I'm on a long break right before Valentines and booked a visit to see some friends; coincidentally at the same university that she goes to. Seeing this as an opportunity, I was thinking of asking her out, but I'm questioning whether the mutual attraction will still be there or not. Have I waited too long for something to happen? (Two years).

TITLE: Me [33 F] with my Ex [38 M] 1.5 years. Am I just a romantic, or does anyone believe in ""choosing"" to love anymore or is all just based on how you feel?
POST: I don't want to be long and I'm not going to go into the nitty-gritty details, as I don't feel it is particularly necessary for my question.  It's a simple question: am I incorrect that I believe there are points in a relationship that you ""choose"" to love someone; you don't always ""feel"" like it? That isn't to say those feelings don't come back. Everyone has ""off"" times. When I feel depressed, I make a choice to find a way to be happy in some way each day, even though I don't feel like it. I ""fake"" it for a while, but then one day I realize I really do ""feel"" happy again. I have always believed it worked the same for relationships.

To provide a little background, this is the second time my ex broke up with me because, while we mesh and get along very well, and work together great, and yes, he ""loves"" me...he just doesn't ""feel"" it.  Does anyone make a choice to continue to love someone anymore? Or is everyone just out for the ""feels""?  Am I incorrect in my thinking because on the days I don't feel like it, I make the choice to continue to love them and commit to them?

I don't know - maybe some of you have relationships where you ""feel"" like it all the time. I haven't experienced it yet - is this what we are ""supposed"" to be working for?

There, she tells me she hooked up with someone right before we became serious in a less than safe manner and it may have not been my pregnancy (and dealing with that ain't cheap). I felt that as we weren't together at the time I had no right to be mad, but the notion that it was someone else's and that it was hidden from me over all the heartbreak really fucked with me.

TITLE: My boyfriend (26m) and I(21f) have drunkenly decided to break up the past two nights.
POST: Sorry if this doesn't flow very well, I'm on my cell phone.

We have been together for two years and have always been open about everything. I have always known he doesn't want children and he has always known that I do want children. However, I don't want children for another ten plus years. So we decided to stay together until then. Being that we're so young, the chances of us staying together that long are slim. I would never press him to change his mind because I do not want him resenting me, our children, or himself. 
Two nights ago we were drinking at home and he told me that he feels like we have no future, naturally, I understand. We decided we still want to stay together, but he wants to be in an open relationship. We've talked about it before, we both think it would be fun/beneficial. I know that right now I can't emotionally handle it though. I'm pretty confident in myself but I'm still a jealous girlfriend. Not overly jealous, but I mean I still have feels. He wants to start the open relationship now because he feels like he's just going to get older and unattractive. He said he understood how I felt and would be patient with me. So we're not rushing into anything. 
We both love each other very much, we're each others best friend. But it has been awkward since then and I feel like he's unhappy or weary. 
Any advice that you guys can share with me? Will it only get worse from here?

TITLE: The plague of ITBS
POST: Hi all. I got hit with ITBS in my right leg while training for a half marathon in October. It was a bummer, but I accepted that I was probably pushing it too much in terms of mileage, not doing the rights things in terms of stretching+conditioning, etc. etc. 

I essentially took off from running from November through January after seeing a sports medicine doctor, while also doing a lot of cross-training, Theraband exercises, and foam rolling. 

As of this past week, I've started to train for a marathon in May. First few runs went great, but during a very casual jog yesterday the ITBS in my right leg flared up in full force. **Not only that, it felt just as painful as it did in October**. I'm feeling despondent about this right now. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to overcome this injury? I've done a lot of research already, but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything.

TITLE: My husband [M30] might've done something unsavory with my best friend's [F27] underwear.
POST: It's a long weekend here in Canada, so last night my husband [M30] and I [F27] had my best friend Megan [F27] over for a BBQ & a hot-tub. After dinner, Megan used our bathroom to change into her swimsuit. I waited for her, and when she opened the door I saw her clothes folded in a pile on the bathroom counter.

We got in the hot-tub and my husband joined us about 10 minutes after. We stayed in for about an hour, then came inside and watched a movie, still in our towels and bathing suits. Megan & I must've fallen asleep on the couch halfway through the movie - I vaguely remember waking up around midnight to my husband covering us both with blankets.

Around 2AM, I woke up and went to the bathroom. I noted that my husband was still awake, as the light in his office was on. This in itself wasn't usual - on the weekends he's a night-owl.

At 6AM, I woke up again VERY dehydrated. This usually happens when I have too much to drink. I went to the bathroom to get a glass of water, and this time Megan's teal booty shorts were on the top of her pile of clothes. I am 100% certain they were NOT on the top of the clothes pile when I went to the bathroom at 2AM. 

My husband has a thing for panties. When we have sex, sometimes he'll grab the panties I was just wearing, hold them to his nose and inhale deeply. Given the timeline, I think my husband took her panties into his office, masturbated with them, then replaced them. Right now, all I can say for certain is he moved them.

Megan woke up and left 20 minutes ago. My husband is passed out snoring in our bed. I am just sitting here at a loss, thinking WTF I should say when he gets up. This is the first time anything like this has happened. We have had zero problems with infidelity in our relationship. We've been together 6 years, married for 2 years.

oookk... sure it's related to the topic of weather but that doesn't really answer my question.

This happens all the time to me with them. Whether it's my conversation or I'm listening to their conversations I constantly notice these strange events. It's as if they're stupid or something but I refuse to believe that.

Example of a conversation my roommates had that I overheard:
Matt: ""the fitness plan says we are supposed to eat 3 times a day within 8 hour periods""
Katt: ""How is that different from what we are already doing?""
Matt: ""Well by keeping food within 8 hour periods we should be stabilizing our metabolism""

This conversation angered and frustrated me because the meaning of Katt's question seems to have been completely disregarded. Matt's appropriate response should have compared the similarities to their previous meal plan and the one he was suggesting. They are already eating within 8 hour periods a day, that's what Katt was saying.

I know this isn't healthy for a relationship, And I want to fix it, but there are just some things that stick out in my mind all the time, and nag, and harp on me, like the fact she got an abortion 3 years ago, or all the sexual activities she has done.

TITLE: Reddit, any advice for three college girls living with an 80 year woman on how to handle this delicate situation?
POST: So for various reasons I had to find an apartment this year on short notice and ended up signing a lease for a room in a 4 bedroom apartment with strangers. When I first moved in, 2 other girls in their early twenties were living in the other two rooms on the second floor, where my room also is. About a week after I moved in, an 80 year old woman moved into the room on the first floor. Considering I live in an almost exclusively college-aged building and neighborhood, this was a little weird and unexpected, but not really a huge deal.

The problem, unfortunately, is that she is incontinent and smells strongly of urine. To compound matters, she has basically turned the entire living room into an extension of her bedroom and spends all day sitting in there. When I accidentally made the mistake of sitting of ""her"" coach, I quickly found the entire cushion was soaked through. The smell permeates the entire first floor of our apartment. Initially we tried to address this by leaving air fresheners all over the first floor and keeping the windows open. While this didn't completely mask the smell, it helped enough that we could at least go downstairs. Now that it's winter in Wisconsin, we've had to close our windows and the smell is unbearable. It's gotten to the point where we hardly ever use the kitchen or living room, and can basically never have people over.

My other roommates and I have decided we need to finally find some way to address this with her but have no idea how to bring it up. On the few occasions where we've tried to talk about other concerns with her (such as leaving half eaten meat and dairy products in our dish cabinet for days on end) she became very hostile and defensive. I know there are some things you just can't control as you age and I want to be sensitive of her situation, but the rest of us are paying rent too and have been forced into a fairly impossible living situation.

Reddit, is it really possible she doesn't already know about this? Whether she does or doesn't, how could you ever go about bringing this up to someone? I feel really uncomfortable about potentially embarrassing her and would greatly appreciate any advice you can give!

POST: So, my best friend and I are both engaged. I've been dating my fiancé for three+ years and have known him my whole life; she has known her fiancé for about 7mths. This is mildly important later on. 

Her and I have had some problems, basically her putting guys ahead of me (cancelling plans, never responds, not setting boundaries, letting her guys talk to me negatively, etc). Since we both got engaged, I honestly didn't know if I wanted her as my MoH because we seem to be growing apart and her fiancé has been so negative towards me and my fiancé. But she has been my best friend for 10 years and I consider her and her family MY family. I wouldn't know who else could fill her role.

I view her fiancé as very controlling, which is a completely different topic- but as a result I hardly talk to her/see her. Since they began dating I've only seen her once alone, and she was on her phone with him nearly the whole time. 

She hasn't been involved in my wedding planning at all, nor has asked about it. Her wedding isn't going to be for another year and a half- so she doesn't want to start planning yet even though I make sure to ask if she needs anything (she also asked me to be her MOH). 

I bought my dress yesterday and sent her a picture. I was very self conscious about the fit in the tummy- but my aunt and mom assured me that it only looked that way because of it being cinched to stay up. And I plan on losing some weight and wearing spanx. Instead of telling me I looked nice, or anything positive- she basically mirrored all my self criticisms and added ""I hope your ordered a bigger size"". Then the conversation moved to her wedding and her life again. All of the joy I felt about finding my dress was squished by her negative comment.

A lot of other stuff has happened to make me reconsider her place in this wedding, but this is already stupid long. Has anyone else had this issue, and how did you handle it tactfully?

TITLE: Would you rather be a farmer or a programmer?
POST: True story. I'm a young (18 years old) person facing this almost laughable decision.

I'm a student with definitely above average marks who's going to go study mathematics at university. I also love programming and have been learning programming by myself since I was 13 or so. My objective would be to either do research, or do some interesting and well-paid job at a IT/software company.

Now, on the other side. My father is a farmer and he would like to see me continue its job. He already owns everything I would need: The fields, the machinery, some forests...

I live in Spain, which hasn't any big IT/software/research companies. I've been thinking about potentially emigrating but that's a whole different matter. I don't even know if I'm as valuable as I believe...

On the farmer side, I'm worried about the energy crisis... I've potentially got 60 years more to live and lots of things can happen to me and my loved ones. Peak oil, global warming, population growth, population ageing... all of those things are happening and I fear the possibility of a huge crash. What's obvious is that things must change. What's debatable is by how much.

TITLE: I think I have separation anxiety? M&F 19-20 together for 2 years.
POST: I [19F] think I have separation issues. 
Whenever my bf [M20] leaves for work or to go back home I start to feel very sad.  I get tired, depressed, and I just kinda loose interest in everything. 

It starts to happen about a hour before I know he is leaving. I wasn't always like this though. We have been together for 2 years, and I've only started this the last year. 

The only medication of any kind I'm on is birth control. I do have stress issues, I have a bit of a tragic background. He came into my life at a shakey time and made things better for me. 

Does this sound familiar? I don't think I should be that sad. He knows I get sad too, and I feel bad. I know its okay to miss him, but once he is gone for maybe 1 week & 1/2 I tend to just stay in my room and sleep. 

Any ideas what is up with this?

TITLE: I [25 M] made my GF [25 F] of 9 months feel like I think she's an idiot. How can I avoid doing it again?
POST: For her studies, my GF is doing a project in which a lot of the work is in my area of expertise. As you might expect, she's been asking me for help a lot, and I've been trying to help as much as I can. 

Unfortunately a lot of the time I don't really enjoy helping her all that much. I sometimes feel like she doesn't really understand what she's doing, and is just putting things together in a way that works without understanding why it works. I'll readily admit that I have some (unwanted) elitist attitudes when it comes to my field. I wish I didn't but I do, and they make it harder for me to help her.

In any case, today she was telling me how it wasn't possible for her to do something, and without really thinking I replied something along the lines of ""of course you can do that, all you have to do is this other thing"". Usually you would be able to do the thing she wanted to do, but in her particular case, she was correct that you can't do it.

She later told me that the way I responded really made her sad, that it made her feel like I thought she was an idiot. Of course I didn't want to make her feel that way, but I guess my response really projected that attitude. Instead of assuming that she had done her research, and thinking for 2 seconds about what she was telling me, I assumed that she was missing something really basic and was just wrong.

How can I change my own thinking to be less judgmental and more supportive of my SO?

TITLE: Following my passion: working with the forefather of a field (x-post from AskReddit)
POST: Alright Redditors, I need your help.

After spending the majority of my life interested in applying principles from my various studies to human interactions, I discovered a field that directly studies that interest. Basically, I found my passion on a chance video from ted.com (yay for the interweb).

First, I caught hold of a phrase in a video about advertising - Behavioral Economics. Then I researched it, read everything I could about it, contacted professors at local colleges, and even spoke to the forefather of it himself - Dan Ariely: 

It's been a few months since we spoke, but I want to pursue a Ph D. in Behavioral Economics. I also want to continue my career. So, my questions/comments:

1) I believe that creativity and effort most often allow individuals to side step standard 'sacrifices' for what they want. You're welcome to say that it cannot be done or that I clearly don't want it enough if I won't give up my career, but realize that I'm only interested in solutions, not road blocks. I will read your comments but I won't bother arguing and it's unlikely to change my mind.

2) I want to perform a study of Behavioral Economics as it applies to my field, process automation. I have a pretty clear picture of the studies I would like to pursue, what I am seeking is advice on how best to present them to Dan to sell him and/or other behavioral economics professors into agreeing to allow me to pursue and publish remotely and/or as a part of my greater job function.

3) How to actually knock out prerequisites, work remotely from the institutions I want to be associated with (Dan is at Duke, I live in Houston and my research would be best carried out here)? have any of you heard of Ph. D's being granted to people doing research in industry? I've researched it and found examples, but I have no clear indicators whether it's feasible and/or common in Economics.

I'll be around until about noon CST if anyone has more detailed questions, I know I left a hell of a lot of detail out.

Thanks!

TITLE: Me [21 M] just broke up with my GF [19 F] of close to three years, thought I knew why but now I feel unsure
POST: A few months ago I began feeling doubts our relationship. I was getting interested in dating other people and the thought of being with some us felt appealing. I felt bad staying in a relationship I wasn't fully committed to so I explained it to her and we broke up.

We decided to take a break from each other, no talking or being with each other for a few weeks but we thought eventually we might try to become friends again.

A few weeks after the initial break up we remember we had pretty nice concert tickets we had bought a few months prior to all this happening, we didn't want them to go to waste so we decided to go as friends. 

We ended up hooking up the night of the concert and we decided we were going to try to work on the relationship and entered this gray area of kind of together. We hung out and talked and had sex but it still felt slightly different. About two weeks ago I started feeling like it wasn't going to work out. For the last week we barely talked or hung out. Then we sat down and talked it out and I ended it completely. 

That was a week ago and ever since I've felt hollow and numb and depressed about the situation. Before when we broke up I think the idea of us possibly getting back together floated around my head but this seems so much more concrete and it feels weird knowing we might not ever be together again.

I just don't know if I selfishly made a terrible decision or what and didn't really have anyone else to talk to about it.

But it's not like our relationship was bad...in fact it was wonderful, perfect, and everything I had ever wanted but we'd been long distance and I felt like I needed a change and all at once I just opened my mouth and told him I wasn't coming home that I wanted to stay and teach and travel and when he offered to come with me I just couldn't say yes I just couldn't because I've never been out on my own or just done something for myself and I ended it. 

And now I just sit and think all the time about how I feel like I've made a huge mistake and I get so upset because I'm just alone. I'm not made to be alone. I'm a girlfriend it's who I am and now I'm without my other half and it's all so confusing because on the one hand I love him and I miss him and I just want to go home and say I'm sorry and go back to reality but on the other hand, I've got a chance to go out into the world and live the kind of life that other people look at and say 'wow I wish I was her' and I want that, I do, I want it badly. 

I know this was just a ramble but basically what I'm asking for is for anyone else out there whose ever had a breakup from circumstance and not because a lack of love to tell me it'll be alright.

POST: My sister 21/f has lived for about two years with an engaged couple who I think are 32/m and 26/f from my snooping on Facebook and asking around. They've been engaged since this past fall and seem to be getting married in about a year from now. I'm concerned for her because she kind of acts like he's her boyfriend and his fiancee is her girlfriend or something?

They've been seen in public being really close to each other in every combination you can think of with him/his fiancee, him/my sister, my sister/his fiancee, and I actually saw her kiss his fiancee on the lips when the three of them were getting in their car leaving a restaurant in town around Easter, which is what made me finally decide to post this.

He's way too old for her, and her living with a couple like this is just super weird. Everyone in our family talks about her and how they think he's going to kick her out or something once he gets married. Also, she works basically part time at a retail store and he works doing something at home (she won't tell me anything other than ""he works on the computer""), but apparently he's got the money to fix her car when it messes up and pay all of their bills, and that just seems like something he could hold over her head.

I don't really know what to do here because she won't listen to anybody, and I am very concerned for her.

TITLE: Me [22 M] and my ex [20 F] are dating again, but have some resentment issues
POST: So this girl and I dated for a little over a month and it was GREAT, we had a lot of chemistry, in bed and otherwise. And honestly I had never felt so connected to a previous gf right off the bat.

Issues surfaced because I decided to visit one of my best (female) friends in another city for valentines day. Keep in mind I bought the tickets before meeting the ex. I had let her know from the beginning and repeatedly asked her if she wanted me not to go (she said I should go). I also made several things to make up for it.

Travel day comes, and she decides to brake it off BC of jealousy issues and BC she is having ""family problems"". I felt blindsided because I felt I had done everything to avoid this, and felt like she encouraged me to go.

A few months later we start talking again and dating. The topic of the breakup comes up when I tell her I really resent her for what she did, to which she replies that I ""screwed us up"". Her reasoning being that i should have stayed instead even though I repeatedly told her I was willing to do that if she asked. I am honestly shocked that she could think that, am I truly at fault for not reading her mind? Or was I just really dense in not assuming that was what I should have done?

Now I don't know whether I should still try to work things out with this girl. I still really like her.

TITLE: My (20F) SO (21M) of 4yrs moved 30hrs away without discussing it with me... am I overreacting for being upset?
POST: Okay so my SO and I have been in a relationship for 4yrs, he's great and I love him very much. We have always been able to communicate openly in our relationship, which is why we get along so well.

We both just finished our 3rd year of university. During 3rd year he was looking for a co-op placement for a 16 month term. We had discussed him possibly moving away to another city within our province, which would make it easy for us to drive/bus/train to visit each other frequently. He applied to many positions in our province, however he also applied to some out of province - without telling me.

As it turns out, the first job he gets an offer for is 30hrs away. They gave him around 24hrs to decide whether or not he was going to accept the job. That night we went to his parents house to discuss with them. His father told him he should accept it immediately, while his mother and I suggested he slept on it as he had other job interviews in the upcoming week in our city and other cities within the province. During this conversation, his father repeatedly shuts down any suggestions other than ""Accept it!!"".

Ultimately, without really sitting down and having a discussion about how this was going to work, he accepted the offer that night and that was that. When we talked about it later, he told me that he assumed that I would just pack up and move there with him - something that we had never discussed. He moved to the other province a month ago and won't be back home until fall of next year.

I understand that 16 months isn't the end of the world and that we are young and we both need to make decisions that will benefit our future and careers, but I can't help but feel upset that he did not include me in this huge decision. There's not much we can do about it now, but this has been really bothering me for the last few months.

Any advice on how to let this go or from anyone in a LDR would be appreciated!

POST: I was recently searching for a job and my aunt decided to ""help me out"" (by sending me over 9000 links a day to job postings). One of the links she sent me struck me (on first glance) as a local jobs-posting site. The frontpage seemed just to be a registration form.

Is this legal of him to do? I made copies of the lease agreement and it says nothing against my collection, as long as I did not hang anything on the walls, which I did not. I am not necessarily interested in getting into a legal battle with him or anything, I just want to know if it's legal for him to kick me out over two weeks earlier than my predetermined date.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 7 years, she needs time
POST: So let me start off by saying that I am now in a much better place than when this began about a week ago.  I have gotten a lot of solid advice from friends and family.

We, like all couples, have had our issues in the past.  It has always been small things however, never anything on the scale of cheating or violating one another's trust.  And we have never been afraid to talk things out or tell each other how we feel.  And we have always said that if one of us isn't happy, that we would never want to force the other to stay.

That being said, she dropped a bomb on me last week where she needs time and space to think about what she wants.  Now, out of the 7 years we have been together, roughly 5 have been long distance.  Not across the country long distance, but between 2-4 hours apart.  So we typically see one another once to twice a month minimum during the stretches where we are apart - with the occasional exception to this trend due to outside circumstances.  And we are currently living about 2 hours apart.  We have not lived together either, however the other two years we did live in the same small town.

We have still been talking regularly, however about the little things in life.  How our days are going, what's going on with other people in our lives, work, etc.  But she does not want to talk about us at the moment.  And as I'm sure you can imagine, that is all I want to talk about.

I've tried to stay strong - and so far have done a fairly good job I think (apart from the first day/night where I was not in a good place mentally).  I'm trying to let her have her time and space.  But every day is an internal struggle with myself.  And I know it's beyond my control and the ball is in her court, but this has been one of the longest and most difficult weeks in my life.

I guess I'm just looking for some support.  Thanks for reading.

TITLE: Me [23F] and [39M] giving me hot and cold signals. I don't know whether I should tell him.
POST: So there's this guy I'm really close to even though I've only known him for a little over a year. I don't know how to romantically approach guys or anything like that. I can always tell when my other friends are crushing / being hit on but I can never do so for myself.

He tends to initiate the daily texts even when he's on holiday or with his friends, cheers me up when I'm feeling down, encourages me to be my best, etc. He buys me a lot of stuff when he sees something that reminds him of me, and I do the same as well. 

I am aware that we have a significant age gap and I know I'm far from mature but we're both on similar wavelengths when it comes to our lifestyles, ideals, etc. We hang out together and sometimes with his friends (and members of his family) too. Every time we're together he always makes me laugh and we tease each other a lot. And I realize from time to time that he likes to rest his knee against mine, even though he has a lot of chair space to himself.

He sometimes would tell me about girls who hit on him and he's not interested. He's confided in me about his past relationships and warned me of guys I should watch out for. Occasionally he says that he and his bros should help me find a guy. And our interactions are strange. He'd hug all his friends (girls and guys) and I'd do the same, but we don't do that to each other. It's never been our thing, and we always have an awkward wave at the end of the night. And one day one of his friends said she couldn't see him without me by his side and I freaked. 

Because of the hot/cold vibes I can't tell if he likes me or not. And telling him feels like such a risk because I might destroy an amazing friendship. And I've never confessed to a guy before, so I'll probably shit myself doing that and be a blubbering mess :/ I'm not a flirty person, so it'll probably be like dropping a bomb on him too.

POST: My fiance and I have been in a million fights about him giving away the only time we have with just each other to his other friends.  I work or go to school multiple evenings a week, and he has his 2 sons 40% of the time. We rarely have time to spend a few good hours together in a row.    

This evening he got home around 6:30 and I thought we were going to have the rest of the evening together.  We go to the gym, and as soon as we get there he announces that he has to go to his house (which he is renting to a friend of his and still stays at sometimes) to snowblow the driveway.  He left three hours ago, and his friend checked in on Facebook with him at a restaurant that he had just told my fiance has a great beer selection.  

I knew when he left that he was going to end up hanging out with his friend all night.  I could have told him to come right back, but then he would have insisted that was the only option.  I know I didn't say anything so that he would confirm my expectations.  He did, and now I'm angry and hurt.  We have fought about this so many times before, and our fights always get explosive and overblown.  Whenever he is criticized, he gets defensive and mean, and then ultimately ends up agreeing he was a dick.  Then nothing changes.  

How the hell do I get things to change? I'm so tired of this.  I know I struggle with my own pride and wanting him to figure shit out because I matter and not because I said to.  We've been fighting a lot lately, and I don't know how I can remotely say something with it not being a huge argument.

TITLE: NSV: A failure this week made me realise how far I've come
POST: My NSV actually comes on the wings of defeat. On Tuesday I totally binged, like, really bad, plus I'm working the back shift this week and it's screwing with my schedule. As a result, when I went to the gym the next day I failed miserably. Possibly one of the worst days I can recall recently at.

But, this lead to me realizing three victories I have had that I wouldn't have realized without this off day.

1) I have come SUPER far on my journey. I'm 35lbs down, and even though I failed my routine the other day, I still wouldn't have even been able to do it half that well a few months ago. So it may have been an off day for me considering the stage I'm at now, but it showed me that I really have come so far. 

2) It showed me how important maintaining good eating habits really is. One bad day like that made me bloated, sick, and caused me to seriously under perform. Lesson learned! 

And 3) I have had a total shift in attitude. A few months ago if I failed as poorly as I just did, I probably would have given up and relapsed into old habits. But now? Now I'm even more determined to continue to improve and impress myself even more than I have. This time getting healthy is about ME. I want to prove to myself that I can do it, and it's working.

So even if you have a shitty day, week, or month, remember that you're still miles ahead of where you would be if you never even tried. So pull yourself back together and keep going. One successful day won't end in perfect results, just like one bad day won't ruin everything you've worked for.

TITLE: Amino energy before runs?
POST: I did my first ever 7 mile run yesterday and felt like I could go miles and miles further when I was done.  The person I run with was extremely exhausted by the end of it and started to slow down a lot the last two miles.  We've run 4-5 miles a handful of times and I'm the one that is normally cursing the world at the end of it while she could keep running.  

I thought this was pretty weird since she is much better at getting the other days of running and other cardio in training for a half marathon while I am normally too exhausted after lifting to do the full amount on our plan.  

On the 7 mile run I figured I needed a boost before hand so I had some amino energy, and sure enough by the end of the run I felt like a million bucks.  I was also pretty pumped to set a personal best for distance in one run though too.  I was wondering if the reason I felt so much better even though I ran 2 miles further than ever before was the amino energy, the excitement from setting a personal best, a mix of both, or neither?
TL;DR: ","Runner wonders if taking amino energy supplement before his first 7-mile run contributed to feeling great afterwards, questions if it's the supplement or personal satisfaction."

TITLE: Concerned about my friend's health, nowhere to turn.
POST: I'm typing this shaking right now, so bear with me.

My best friend of my entire life, birth to now, just called me to say his mom left his dad. But it isn't that simple, as in a regular divorce.

His mom has a very obscure mental disorder, an offshoot of bipolar and schizophrenia. The medication she takes restricts her episodes to occurring every few years and they change each time. We think this is one of them, she was having some physical symptoms, but nothing we could point to. She flat out left his dad, but I don't have all the reasons now.

The plot thickens, as they have 3 sons. The youngest my friend, is 18. The other 22, another 25. The 25 year old has the same disorder as his mom, and is at home recovering from the first episode he had, triggered by a separate family issue. It is very much so within the realm of possibility that my friend has the same disorder, and I'm worried for his mental health. 

He's expressed that he is distraught over the leaving, but feels mentally normal. I need to know how to help him. I guess that the best course of action would to not speculate on the disorder and help with the issue at hand, the grief of his parents splitting. Could somebody with experience in helping people, or dealing with divorce, please help me? I don't know what to say to him. Please, anybody, with anything help me. He's my best friend and it's killing me to see him like this.

Shit, I started crying now... Dammit.

TITLE: My sister from Germany's kids have been taken into foster care.
POST: My divorced 23 year old Sister (on my Stepdad's side ) who lives in Germany has 2 daughters, aged 2 and 4.we'll call her Mary. She's been dating a man for a few months and has become pregnant with twins with her new man.

Mary and her ex are currently in a custody battle, with the usual stuff flying back and forth, he claims she treats the children like animals, leaving them in their own filth and refusing to change their dirty clothes - she claims he threatens to kill her and the kids whenever he gets angry, hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying in these situations.

Mary's sister sides with the ex, they've got a strained relationship, always trying to make the other seem like a bad mother so her testimony is suspect.

Anyways, on to the dilemna, Social Services have stepped in and taken Mary's children, according to Mary they will be in care until a decision is made on who the kids will live with, is this a likeley scenario in Germany, or is it more likely that she is actually an unfit mother? Mary doesn't seem to be doing anything towards regaining custody of her kids, after 2 weeks she finally told me she'd arrange an appointment with a lawyer, she has no clue what her rights are in this situation and doesn't seem to be in any hurry to fight for her children - she just bought a new house with her new man, in preperation for the twins arrival.

We are ignorant as to how the German custody system works, as we live in the UK but we need to know whether or not my Mother and Stepfather can step in and request custody, does anybody have any experience with the German social care system?

Ideally we want the kids to go back to their Mother, as we have no evidence that she is an unfit mother, but if it is permanent and not temporary and she is just lying to save face, we have a loving home waiting in the UK for them.

Both kids daughter 6 and son 10 stayed with her. We had some contact since but the last two weeks we barely sent any messages to each other, yet I have been talking to both my kids on phone regularly.

Tomorrow I am flying to them for 4 days.  As the contact to my wife has become less in the past weeks I think that that is a sign for loosing our relationship. She has not started any chat, always only replies to my messages. Has not called only responded to my calls. 

I am not sure how to behave when we will meet. Do I hug her or just say hello? Do I show my feelings that I am sad and want our family back together or do I play the ""life is good"" part? Should I bring her a gift? (Since I left I sent two boxes with presents to them, my wife said thank you but without any comments or sign of joy). Sent her flowers on our 13th wedding anniversary, got only a thank you message in whatsapp. Should I try to talk to her about our relationship or should I leave this topic out as she always tells me not to pressure her.

POST: I accidentally (yes, for real) stumbled upon the ""meet me app"" on my husbands phone. 

He claims that he was using it to try and meet friends in our area. (He is a stay at home father and in general doesn't have any pals)  For the most part, his replies to other people were innocuous, but he recently posted about getting a cock ring and wanting to test it on someone (and we did later that night).

When I confronted him about the app he explained that he wanted to make friends, but specifically, female friends- but only since he hasn't had any female friends since college (which is when we got together). I desperately want to believe this since I know he gets pretty lonely around here with just our toddler to keep him company. He deleted the app at my insistence, but I know that doesn't mean much. 

I want to believe that he is innocent and I'm freaking out, but at the same time, I subscribe to the Steve Harvey school of thinking about heterosexual friendship. 

I'm an incredibly jealous and territorial woman (we're both in late 20s, been together for 10 years), so the fact That he even wants ""girl-friends"" gets me riled.

As our relationship got more serious, she started asking when we would get married. I have always told her that it was too early and that we needed to get our things in order.

We've been very close and happy until this morning when she finally broke down and told me that if I don't want to get married, there is no need for her to be in the relationship. I do not consider getting married - not with her, not with anyone else. I love her very much but she is giving me an ultimatum that I don't think I can say yes to.

POST: Her and I started dating before my senior/her junior year in high school. I went to college in a different state for my first year and a half and I broke up with her when I was home over break halfway into my freshman because the long distance thing wasn't gonna work for us and I thought it was for the better.

When I came home that summer we started hanging out, going out to dinner, and having sex just like before. I never wanted to make things official again because I would just be leaving for school again in a few months. I continue this with her til the day I left for school. A few weeks of little contact when I'm at school and she texts me to tell me that she has a new boyfriend and that she is sorry. I was really mad about it at first and thought it was wrong of her, but then again I never put strings on anything when I came home that summer.

Now to the present. A year and a half into college (last Spring) I transferred to a university much closer to my home therefore much closer to her. We have hung out once since then (last Fall maybe), I took her to dinner and we just chatted and hung out with my dog (he's much better with the ladies than I am). When she was leaving my house I kissed her and she didn't pull but I could tell there was nothing to it (if that makes sense). She told me some lines about how she is too busy with school/work/etc etc etc to be dating anyone and brought up things that I mistreated her when I left for school, old issues.

We still talk now time to time, mostly casual stuff about work and school. She is open to making plans though, but assures me her schedule is really busy. What is my best plan of action to make her fall for me again or should I just be done with it?

POST: My ex and I were together for about 1.5 years. We broke up 4 years ago.

He's autistic. He's not low functioning but he struggled with communication and social interactions significantly.  I tried my best during those 1.5 years but it was so difficult. I loved him and wanted the best for him but being with him had become very difficult. So I left. He didn't want us to break up and told me that he'd try to change but he had promised me that too many times before. I don't blame him, it's a disability, but I couldn't stay in that relationship. I knew he'd be hurt so I suggested that he'd get help dealing with it.

Anyway, we didn't remain in contact. At that time I was friends with his sister but she never talked to me after I broke up with him.

Last week I started a new job. I had no idea he's working at the same place but I saw him there. We didn't talk much, only that I started working here. It's a big company and we work in different departments, we won't run into each other regularly.

Today his sister called me and asked to have lunch. I agreed. Well she freaked out completely on me. I had never seen her like that. It was like she hated me in every imaginable way. She told me I shouldn't talk to my ex, I shouldn't even look at him, I shouldn't try to enter his life and if she learns that I've done anything to get close to him she'll make sure my life is a living hell and that I have no idea what she's capable of.

I was shocked at her level of anger and asked if something had happened to him and she told me that I left so I don't have a right to ask questions. She repeated the threats.

I'm still in shock. My mom thinks I should go to the police although I don't think she's a violent person. She was angry. I don't know what to do here.

POST: My current girlfriend is the only girl I've ever had penetrative sex to orgasm with. We've been having sex using the pull-out method, but the other week I got a little excited and didn't pull out in time. Now, even though she's on the pill, she insists on me using a condom. The problem is that I simply can't have an orgasm in a condom, I've never been able to, and I have rarely been able to stay hard long enough to put one on. 

This problem is made worse by her unwillingness to return oral sex. I go down on her frequently, usually multiple times in one night and then again in the morning for good measure, but she never returns the favor. I don't know if she has any particular reason other than perhaps it just grosses her out, but I feel like I'm being left hanging. 

So my current situation is that I can't get oral from my girlfriend, and I also can't keep it up while wearing a condom, so I'm left finishing myself off when she leaves. 

The condom thing is more important to me. I feel like this is a bigger issue, since I feel like I should be more aroused than I am, and seeing that most guys don't seem to have a problem maintaining and finishing with a condom.

Out of habit I usually have 2-3 emtpy clear plastic bottles saved up for holding automobile fluids for inspection, hence the reason I still had this particular empty bottle. Many hours later, dying of thirst, I spied the Dr. Pepper bottle on the work bench and decided ""wow, that would really hit the spot right now"".

The first time I saw the pictures I was devastated, this ex of his cheated on him and strung him along for a long time before he caught her. They had dated all through high school, and he's had 3 girlfriends his whole life (I'm the third) so I know he's the type to get really attached to his girls. He assured me he hadn't looked at them for awhile and that he would delete them immediately (and showed me as he deleted them). I felt bad for snooping.

See, the pictures are on his Google drive and I looked through his ""recent"" list, there they were, also further looking at the information details, they had been deleted then restored the very next day. I did not confront him about this because I was very ashamed at myself for snooping especially when I had told him I wouldn't do it anymore.

TITLE: My SO [22 M] and I [21 F] relationship completely destroyed but I always catch myself coming back
POST: We've been together for about 3 1/2 years now. We are in long distance about 700 miles away. He's always been very controlling/manipulative about a lot of things. Doesn't like when I go out or hang with friends, hold a conversation with guys who are my friends, etc.

Things hit rock bottom when we both ended up cheating on each other. I slept with someone while he slept with 3 girls. After coming to me and telling me he felt bad, he confessed his 'love' towards me and all. However, I found out he was still hooking up with one of the girls from before and I believe still is even though he tells me he doesn't. My gut just gives me a feeling it's still going on.

I find it really hard to let go because since it is long distance, things could be a lot different between us if we could be together more. That's why I'm always coming back to him. However, after something like this happened, I don't know if things will ever change. 

I don't want to continue to live my life being paranoid and in fear that this stuff will continue to happen while he plays with my head. How can I just learned to move on with my life without him?

TITLE: boyfriend may have issues with my fraternity
POST: Throwaway account because boyfriend is also redditor.

I am f/22 and boyfriend is same age. We have been together for 2 years now. I am in a co-ed fraternity and I'm worried my boyfriend is uneasy about some of the stuff we do. My fraternity is probably 2/3 male and 1/3 female, and we are all engineers. For example, we like to throw kickbacks at each other places so I enjoy doing some brotherly bonding that includes drinking. I think my SO may be jealous even though he tells me that he is not the jealous type. I was in the fraternity before we met so I figured he would understand that we do have parties. We go to school in different cities so we don't see each other as much as we like, maybe 2 weekends in a month if we are lucky. He was also angry at me for not telling him that I went clubbing with them during our annual retreat until I got back from it which was the day after. I went with 10 girls including me and only 3 guys. My previous boyfriend broke up with me, partially because I was in the fraternity which is why I tried to make it clear to him that I was in one when we started out.

In the beginning when he was able to hang out for longer periods, I invited him to some of our parties and dinner thing and he enjoyed hanging out with everyone. Now that he's been concentrating on school, he's not around to partake in a lot of the events.

So reddit, how do I make my boyfriend more comfortable about it? I've told him that they are just my brothers and I have no intentions of dating any other guys. Also, how can I get him to feel less angry when I want to go out and do stuff with them? This is my last year at college so I want to make the most of it in case I move far away for work.

POST: When I met Amber I was skinnyfat and broke. Fast forward to today and my career has taken off beyond my wildest dreams. Im making craploads of money. Last summer a bodybuilder friend of mine introduced me to HGH and steroids. Ive done a few cycles since and my body is amazing.

I get A LOT of attention from women. Which is bittersweet as I used to be treated like I was nonexistant. Horny thoughts bombard my mind all day.

My gf Amber has pretty much stayed the same as when I met her. Shes not very ambitious and average in looks. I feel comfortable around her but I have this strong urge to see what else is out there, all those sexual opportunities I didnt have before are here now... but I also feel guilty and selfish thinking this way.

And I feel worse knowing that a year ago we were planning to possibly get married and start a family. My parents like her and her parents adore me. I get along with her siblings etc. It would suck to have to build all that up again.

POST: No earth shattering relationship drama here, but I'm confused. When my husband and I met, we had sex after about a week. He told me that he hadn't had sex in about 4/5 years. As we got to know each other better, I asked him more about his sex life, because I like sharing this kind of stuff. He said that he'd slept with two girls before me (in HS). He also said that sex with them was awkward, especially with his ex gf from High School, because she was very religious.

We've always had a great sex life. He seemed a little inexperienced/rusty in the beginning, but he's great and always takes charge.

So it took me by surprise when I learned today that I gave him his first bj. He was joking around, saying that I'm the nicest girl ever and the only girl who's ever given him a bj. I was shocked. I didn't know that. I asked more about his sex experiences in HS because now I was curious. Well, aparently he's only had sex with one girl, but he was ashamed to admit that to me so he said it was two. Also, this one girl only wanted to have anal sex with him, because she was religious, and I guess she thought that that wouldn't piss god off as much. My husband says that they only had sex a handful of times, and that it was awkward and 'forced' (not as in non-consensual, just with no passion. 

I feel really weird about this - did I take his virginity then?  Is it okay if I'm a little annoyed, because it feels like he lied to me? I just feel superweird about this. Of course not like 'I want a divorce!' W
weird, just weird.

TITLE: [CA] Possible consequences of welfare shenanigans.
POST: Several months ago, my wife and I had a large fight which resulted in my expulsion from the home via restraining order for 10 weeks. I have since resolved (most) of the issues with my wife, but one thing continues to plague both of us.

While I was out of the home, she filed the necessary paperwork to begin receiving benefits from the State. This included CalWorks, a cash benefit, as well as CalFresh, effectively food stamps. She also is receiving assistance for tuition and books at school.

When she signed up for everything, she truthfully advised the social worker that we had 2 kids, and that she was making zero income. The benefits she is receiving were calculated based on those figures. 

Now that I am back home, she is terrified that she is going to get into trouble for taking unauthorized benefits. She told them as soon as I moved back in that I was there, but at the time, we were still working out what would happen with out relationship, and I moved back in purely to avoid having to pay rent at two locations. Nesting is the term, I believe. 

To this day, our relationship is still strained, and we still fight. So much so that she has expressed to me that she still has moments of doubt about where we are going. That is something for /r/relationships though. What I'm wondering is what kind of trouble she could get in to, if any? She has admitted to the social worker that I am back in the house, but I don't know if she formally filed any paperwork alerting them to the change in status. The circumstances regarding our relationship are the same now as they were then: I live there, and we are amicable, but we are more roommates than partners.

The 5 year old can be a hellraiser but he's a good kid.  The 2 month old is..a baby.  He does baby stuff.  He's pretty relaxed, unlike a lot of babies I've seen. Doesn't cry a lot, etc.  We treat him with kid gloves, obviously.  He's a baby.  We're gentle. 

Tonight, she calls and says to me, ""I hate to lose a babysitter but there's a bruise on the baby's back that wasn't there yesterday.""  

This pissed me off, and I repeated what she said back to her, absolutely shocked and confused.  I then handed the phone to my SO, who asked her a few questions, then hung up.  She called the woman back a few minutes later, explaining that we were both very offended that she would accuse us like that.  She claimed that she didn't mean to make it an accusation, and now that she's thought more about it, she thinks it happened when she put him in the sink for his bath, that the sink stopper might have done it.

POST: I've been lurking in loseit for a while (25/M/5'10) and have been using it to get motivation and tips from others to help me find success with my own weight loss. I have something to share which was my motivation for loosing weight and now has put me in a place where I need some help.

About a year ago I met someone online. I had a few dates with this person until he told me how great and wonderful I was but he decided to see someone else. The positioning of his rejection seemed to me that he was rejecting me for my weight, which was 242 at the time.

Over the course of the last year I have dropped my weight to 180 for a 62lb loss. I was happy with myself even though I could still be more little in the middle. 

I decided to try dating again and met someone who I found great comfort being around and to be a wonderful person in general. Things were progressing along swimmingly until recently. After a great date in the park with dinner and drinks things started heating up. About ten minutes in he stopped, looked at me with the saddest face, and said, ""I'm not physically attracted to you and I don't want to continue this relationship."" I was crushed. We talked for about an hour afterwords. As far as breakups go it couldn't have gone better. He said something that resonated with me. He said it more delicately but the gist of it was ""I think you are attractive but I can't get passed your body.""

Now to what brings me here. I've been working hard to get to this point in my weight loss. I just started yoga and have been feeling great. The end of this wonderful romance has made me question myself and my body. I'm disappointed in myself for not trying harder or not seeking out help when I needed it. I have some lack of motivation today for a combination of having my love life snuffed out in a single sentence and a disappointment with my body. I don't know where to go from here.

TITLE: BK, Relief from Stay, and Selling the Loan
POST: Here is a situation I've come across and am interested to hear about the legal ramifications.  Not looking for ""official"" legal advice, just thoughts on the situation.  

BK declared in 2011.  The bank obtained a relief from stay in April 2012 and since that time Borrower has been calling them trying to get the ball rolling on the foreclosure process.  Borrower's ex is unwilling to do a Short-Sale or work toward a DIL for some reason; they are now officially divorced and the only alternative (because it's the only one she is willing to move forward on) is foreclosure.    

Borrower just found out that the bank has sold his loan to another bank. The process is likely to start all over again with ""what can we do to modify this loan for you"" and that will take months to wade through. Good times.

My question is this: If the Borrower's old bank was the one who pursued the relief from stay under the terms of the BK, can that relief from stay just be essentially transferred to the new bank and new servicer?  I understand that the relief from stay allows the old bank the ability to pursue options with respect to moving forward with foreclosure, but can they just sell the troubled loan to another company with the relief from stay in place?

Initially it was just a break, she needed space and so did I. However, I tried to reconcile things last week. She said she didn't want to do distance, saying it made her always miss me and held her back socially. But kept sending mixed signals like she wants to date in the summer around may and how she still feels about me. The discussion ended on poorer terms than I would of wanted. Largely due to me.

I don't know what to do. I personally can't take a pause, I feel like Ill lose the intimacy we had and maybe even her. She's has gone the entire year but bails when we are so close to being together for the summer.

POST: This wont take long, ill give a brief summary of the relationship and then ask the question, I think this is the right subreddit, if not my apologies.

We have been ""together"" for around 8 months now, we dont see much of each other because she is busy so much (she has a kid and a very busy job).  She said I was her boyfriend fairly early on but we havent seen much of each other so Ive never really felt it.

So basically in 8 months ive seen her twice.  I think you can see why I never really felt it.

Anyway the question: earlier today we were talking about this kind of thing and she doesnt think its fair to me to ""have"" to wait even though I said im okay with that.  

She suggested having a ""break"" and thats something Ive never encountered before.  I went along with it because I striaght out told her that if she wanted to end it I would respect her choice and I meant that, I really have a lot of respect for her intelligence.

I get what it means, she wants to be apart for a month or two (her words) and then see how we feel, but given how we almost never see each other this seems more to me like a break up than anything.  Am I wrong in thinking that?  

Cause this sounds to me like just a very slow way for her to break things off.

POST: I teach in Australia, where it is normal for schools to have a 'no-hat-no-play' policy (so in Spring and Summer time, students must wear a hat at break times). My school also has a strict response to bad language. So here I was, on yard duty, on the first day of term after our spring vacation, getting kids to put on their hats and guiding those without them into a sheltered area. I sprung one hatless student on the handball court, and when he told me he'd forgotten his hat, I said he needed to move off the court into the shade. Under his breath he muttered, ""For fucks sake.""

I HATE responding to things like this. I actually don't give a shit. But I'm not meant to let stuff like that go. So I march him up to his classroom teacher, and start to tell the story of what happened. The kid hangs his head in acceptance that he has done something wrong, but when I tell his teacher, ""And then he mumbled under his breath, 'For fucks sake'"", this kid turns white and freaks. ""I didn't say that! I didn't! I said, 'It's the first day'!"" He was telling the truth.

So after apologising to him profusely, I have my fingers crossed that this kid didn't go home and say to his parents, ""A teacher dropped the F-bomb in front of me today"".

This friend group has since drifted apart and I am now one out of two girls in the friend group, the rest are eight boys that my boyfriend and I get along very well with.

The other girl in my group is in a relationship with someone that occasionally but very rarely hangs out with us, so now most times she is off hanging out with his friends, leaving me to be the only girl in the group. I generally get along with boys more than I do with girls, due to growing up a little bit of a tomboy until the age of fourteen (I climbed trees, ripped dresses, dressed in baggy boys clothes, had short hair etc etc). 

That being said, my boyfriend and I had a talk about me finding more girl friends and maybe hanging out with the boys less for it to be healthier as the boys sometimes could not have 'man' talks with a girl around. I completely understand, even though I do not mind, and am used to these chats (that revolve around cars technology and women).

So sometimes I go off and have alone time or hang out with some of my other friends from the gym that I do not see very often.

The rest of these boys are single, and my BF is the only one in a relationship. I want to tell him that staying out until 2am and coming home only when I text him is not ok, as it is making me feel as if i'm his mom. I do go out for drinks as well, but I come home at a reasonable time. Needless to say, I am annoyed. How do I approach this? Am I being unreasonable?

TITLE: House-soiling issues with an 11 year old dog.
POST: Hello,

I'm unsure whether there is a questions thread or whatnot where I can ask the question I have so I made a post instead. Growing up, we had two dogs for the better part of 10 years and recently had to lose one to illness. Our current dog is an 11 year old Pointer mix who was never properly house-trained during those 10 years and has therefore developed house-soiling habits. Growing up I never really paid attention to it as I figured my dad whom had read a few books on the matter had claimed we could fix these habits. I've recently come to understanding that everyone in the house has simply given up on fixing this issue and it annoys me. With a new dog coming into the picture later this summer and a lot of free time this summer I'd like to fix this issue. 

The dog, Ella, has habits of peeing on a training pad at the front door anytime we leave the house or when we go to bed. When she notices we go upstairs to get to bed in the evening, she will within 5 mins, pee on her pad, regardless of whether she's been out for a walk or in the backyard in the past hour. When we leave for extended periods of time(4+ hours) she will poop in the living room creating quite the unpleasant smell for a few hours. 

A relative dog trainer has proposed changing where the training pads are to putting them beside the backdoor, and then gradually showing her to go outside. I've attempted to move the training pad and she will generally move her soiling area to where the pad is however, I'm uncertain on how to go about showing her to go outside or rather how to not pee in the house as I don't believe her issue is a lack of understanding that outside=toilet but rather that her issue stems from the lack of understanding that inside=/= toilet.

Any tips or help in how to break this habit? Will a new dog pick up this habit if the older dog does it?(our 1st dog did not) I'm sorry if the text is long.

POST: I have been single for 7 years after things ended with a great guy. It was because of the long distance but even worse, various deaths and other tragedies in my family, a resulting depression from it and just in general a life that had been tough up until this point. 

I have worked through this and for the last few years have finally been happy. I am living the life the way I want it now, have projects, friends, hobbies, travel etc. But what I haven't been able to find is a genuine man who really is available for true love.

Yes, I know, most people want relationships and love, but that doesn't mean they're truly ready to find their soulmate, stick with her or him to the end, be each others best friend, be completely vulnerable with each other etc.

It just feels like every guy I date has some major hang ups concerning relationships and that's why they're still single in their 30ies. Like they don't want committ, they want the player's lifestyle, or they have some racist or other views I cannot deal with. Or an addiction problem, mostly alcohol. Most guys I meet also seem to have someone somehow, either just sleeping with them, texting them etc. No one is truly available.

I feel like my difficult life has made me miss the chance to meet a guy who is interested in the same thing I am: committment, marriage, children, have a good, stable, drama free, drug free life, being kind to each other, making each other happy, being content just to watch a good movie together, have a nice dinner, tell each other all the stories, be there for each other through the good and the bad days... well you know you get my drift.

BTW: No, I am not saying it is impossible to get married at my age or just to find someone. This is never hard I guess. My issues is to find someone who is just as romantic and ready for the big deal just like me and doesn't have any major hang ups as described above.

POST: We started off as friends with benefits about 6 months ago. This is probably the longest FWB I've had in the past 3 years. Usually these relationships only last 1-3 months at most. I've never developed any emotional attachment to my previous hook up buddies and now I've gotten myself into a sticky situation. I for once actually care. I've tried hooking up with other girls since we're in an open relationship but I simply feel too guilty even after just making out with another girl. Before, I had no problem fucking two different girls in one day but I actually feel bad. Like I'm doing something wrong when in reality I know I'm not. She has given me the permission to go and sleep with whoever I want.
This has been the most drama filled friends with benefits relationship I've had. About every month she wants to break it off, so we do but then we always end up resuming where we left it off. Well in the past few weeks I've been thinking really hard about how I feel about her and I would really like to date her exclusively. Last night definitely reaffirmed it when I tried hooking up with another girl and I just kept thinking about her and like I said before I've never felt guilty about hooking up with other girls before until now and the worst is we are in an open relationship. I finally have what I always wanted. Someone I can hang out with and I get to have a great time and she also lets me see whoever I want. But the problem is I don't want that anymore. I'm pretty sure I couldn't handle the thought of her being with someone else. I definitely know that shes the only girl I want to be with at the moment.
I also know she really doesn't want a relationship. This is her first friends with benefits she ever had. I can tell she really enjoys the freedom of being able to do whatever she wants and not be constricted to only one person.

Anyways, judging from old patterns I can only wonder when she wants to just be friends again. I'm torn between ending it now before I become even more attached than I already am or should I just stick it through and see what will come of it.

TITLE: Me [35 M] with my wife [35 F] of 11 years, I keep screwing things up, and then screwing up again by not working on fixing it.
POST: My wife and I have been together for about 15 years.  I've done some stupid things, and have hurt her feelings many times in the past.  The biggest things are that I am unreliable.  She can't count on me at all.  My wife is willing to continue our relationship, and I want to work on fixing these past mistakes.  Even though, we are very close to divorce (her words), she and I have been talking every night before bed about the problems we've had, and how I can learn to make things better.

The problem is that we've done this before, and we work on things every night for a couple weeks, and after things go back to a sort of normalcy, I stop bringing it up.  We go back into a routine and we don't talk about the problems and when I do something else to hurt her, everything comes flooding back, and we have to start over at square one.  How do you continue to work through things, without letting things slip back into a routine where it's not discussed?  I genuinely want to work through all these things, but we get busy, or tired, and sometimes it's a whole lot easier to not fight it out.  It's my responsibility to bring this stuff up, she can't bring it up all the time, because I'm the one who's doing the stupid things that hurt her.  She is amazing, and tries, but she's ready to end it with me if we can't get through our backlog, and make things better.

POST: So there's this poetry slam coming up on Tuesday that I'm participating in. I wanted to use either this poem or another, but I wanted her to read it or I wanted to read it to her before anybody else saw it. So I was practicing reading it today in front of the whole class. Obviously everyone knew it was a love poem. My teacher, whom I told this poem was about the girl I've had a crush on, told her to come up to the front of the class so she could see if it was easier for me to read it to one person. Me, a social anxiety valedictorian, thought I was going to screw this up royally, but I took a deep breath, and I read it to her exactly how I wanted to read it to her. It was perfect. One of the best feelings in the world. The best part is, after I read it to her, who was like face to face with me, told me it was a sweet and beautiful poem. This is one of the best days of my life. There's nothing better than pouring your heart out to your crush and acing it, and her saying everything you said was lovely. I hope she comes and watches me perform. That would make my day. I might tell her soon that it's about her. It felt so good to tell her how I feel.

POST: First time poster but long time lurker! As a someone with an extensive Finance background I am struggling to understand the point of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The government did ""bailout"" the banks however, they simply invested money into a system and received a return on investment in return. Yes, Wall Street CEOs get paid tremendous amounts of money but they also have a very high risk/high reward job. If they are successful they should be rewarded as such. If they fail they should be pushed out like many are. Shouldn't the correct focus be on Washington and their failure to prioritize correctly? We have leaders making decisions on sectors of our country that they have no experience. Having a lawyer make business decisions of the country is the equivalent of having a mechanic perform surgery. Help me understand because right now I dont feel as if those within the movement understand the whole picture.

We decided that in addition to free weights and cardio we would try all the machines so he could teach me how to use them. 

So here I am at the leg press. I am doing 110 no problem. My boyfriend decides to bump the weight up to 150. Again it's no big deal. So he says want to try and max out? I say sure. Not really knowing what it means. He puts the weight higher and higher and now I'm at 270 and can't go any higher. 

We decide to move on and do the rest of the machines and by the end I am still feeling great. 

Later that night I was kind of sore when sitting down or having to squat down to pick something up.

I've been dating my AMAZING boyfriend for the last 7-ish months.  Met online and he is the best thing to happen to me in a long time.  He's actually my only second serious relationship.

There's even been two occasions where we stayed up until 6am on a school night and I ended up missing school. There have been a few skype calls as well, and this connection we have is great but...

It's only been a month and I'm incredibly attached to someone I've never met, and it's bugging me. When I'm trying to study I'm thinking about her. I just think about her a lot, and since it's exam season there's nothing I can really do to occupy my mind other than study, which is just hard. I don't know what to do.

We've always talked about taking breaks in talking because it was getting ridiculous but it never happened - until now. We haven't really texted properly in 3 days and I guess it's because she's feeling this too and wants to distance herself maybe as I know for sure she has feelings for me too. However it sucks, so much, and I just want to talk to her, but I keep stopping myself.

We've set up to meet after exams so that we're stress free but I want to meet her sooner. It's TWO months.

TITLE: She [20F] told me [21M] to think about us, and the more I think about it the less inclined I am to carry on with it. Need some perspective from you guys.
POST: So I've been seeing this girl for a month now and she's wonderful in almost every way, except she hates everything about herself (note: she is not depressed, she is incredibly insecure). Now me on the other hand: I'm easygoing and rarely get angry or annoyed by people, I go out of my way to make others happier, and I don't like to think about my own emotions (this last part is important later). 

Today I decided that we need to talk about her insecurity because its starting to pervade into every conversation we have, and she told me that she doesn't want to change her personality for a relationship. This is fine by me, I've known her for a month and I have no place telling her who or what to be. But she was visibly upset by this conversation and asked me what exact traits I liked about her. On the surface of it, I think she's pretty, smart, driven, and lots of great things. But that wasn't the type of answer she was looking for- ""I like you because you're so unique and rare personality-wise for XYZ traits, there's lots of pretty and smart girls"". So I agreed to go back home and seriously introspect on it because it wasn't something I'd ever thought about. 

Now I'm sitting here thinking this.

I do like her and I still can't put words to *why* I do, but the more I think about her personality, the more I realize that she isn't ready to be in a relationship yet. If I go through with this and commit to being with her, I feel like our relationship will be more about her finding herself and me going along for the ride.

I have been dating a wonderful girl over the past year (long distance). Love her lots. But now, a woman has re-entered my life and has brought the doubts I have over my current relationship further into light.

Current doubts: Accepting the worst of my past, being able to move together to another part of the country, pursue progress and life for as long as we live.

Regarding my past; I have brought it up a bit and shocked her. It doesn't seem like it's an important thing in our relationship, but she doesn't want to hear more of it.

Ms. Re-entry. There was crazy passionate love. We were more open with each other than with anyone ever, but I couldn't close the flood gates and she was scared/not mature enough to be up front with me and it ended poorly after a short time. Nearly 2 years later, we are both aware of the mistakes we made, apologized and are back on excellent terms with romance clearly still existing passionately between us.

I have been thinking about this for weeks and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Oh, and though I'm sure a lot of y'all will feel the need to tell me that I am doing something horrible, I hope you can refrain from that. I'm very confused and understand how horrible I am at this moment but I can't wrap my head around all of this and that is what I'm here for.

I am currently the only one of my family capable of passing on my name, I have a cousin and brother but both are still very young. I'm not a stickler for traditions (but I do love/respect them) and was initially open to the idea of possibly sharing last names (smith-jones) since I would like to keep my name (family history and all that) and understood why she wanted to keep hers. 

However she said that she wouldn't want to do a compromise, because it would sound weird on her. She also mentioned that she considers it to be a deal breaker if her future husband is unwilling to take her name, adding on that she fully expects to be single forever. Which hurt a lot more.

My boyfriend [20M] and I [19F] have been dating for two years. We are long distance, maybe a couple hours a part, but we skype quite often; typically we skype for 1.5-4 hours a day ( its not all talking, its more the the comfort of the presence), and let the call run through the night as we sleep which has become routine. 
However, he recently asked for a bit of space, requesting that we limit our calls to one hour a day, but during that time his whole attention will be on me. I'm completely okay with that, it was a bit of a hit to the ego, but if it's what he wants, okay. 

However, 'tis that time of the semester. Exams, and with that being said he doesn't text, doesn't message, doesn't call, and our communication is basically non-existent. And when he does talk to me  it's because I've put in the effort in first. There's no call for one hour as he had said and  I get that school is important, but I've really taken a back seat. This phase will end at the end of his exams which is in three weeks, but I'm pretty sure it'll be similar re-occurring events every time exams come around. Is this normal for most relationships?

POST: A few weeks back during the start of the  school semester I met a girl who it seems that I've clicked well with. We've been hanging out constantly, going to the gym, studying together,  and have gone on several dates. Everything has been going great. However, I think there might be a red flag with her. 

The other night we went out for dinner and then went to the park where we ended up talking for a couple of hours. The conversation led to her mentioning how she was in a shitty relationship with a ex boyfriend form a while back and how they would cheat on each other. My first thought was that this was a deal breaker for me since from what I can tell, people who previously cheat in relationships tend to follow that behavior in future relationships. But then she further explained that her cheating was never physical, only emotional. In my mind, cheating is cheating, but she then further explained that her relationship with this guy was right during the time that her parents were divorcing which was pretty hard on her. 

She told me me how she was very depressed during that time because of her parents divorce which made me think that her emotional cheating was a way of looking for support since her boyfriend wasn't really there for her. She also explained that the relationship was a huge wake up call for her since up until the end of that relationship, she never took her relationships serious. Her mentality was backwards in that if the relationship faced a road block she would want to to break up instead of trying to over come it. 

For the most part, I feel like I should continue to date her and see how things pan out. I feel like I can look past the fact that she cheated on her ex boyfriend, given the circumstances at the time. Although, I slightly feel as if her behavior in her previous relationship is a red flag. Should I be worried?

We fought about it for a week. Lots of lies and anger. In my head I was on a see-saw of forgiving her and moving on, or leaving her. I decided, for the time being, to leave (move out).

During the few days where our relationship was in the dumps we would talk multiple times a day and agreed to see each other on the weekends to see if what we had was salvageable. 

In the meantime she ended up being consoled by some guy whom she had just met: she told him everything about what had happened, then cuddled with him in her bed, then went to his room and did the same. This was the 2nd time she had met him, the 1st was an exchange of hellos. I was told a milder version of this story at first, then the full version after some prodding, much like her cheating story. I decided to drop her and completely ignore her.

Since then shes been texting and calling at an alarming rate. At first the texts were mundane and friendly, mostly about getting closure. They slowly turned desperate and needy. The last 6 texts I got were in the early morning hours, telling me about how horny she was and that she misses the sex and how we used to be.

TITLE: Am I being a bad friend?
POST: Hey reddit. For a couple of years now I've been part of this little group of friends. There's me, some guys, and some girls. We used to hang out all the time, see some movies, go bowling, shoot the shit. We were good friends, really close. So one of the guys, let's call him Chris, started dating one of the girls, let's call her Mary. 

So Chris and Mary date for a bit, seem crazy about each other, and then break up. Chris loses his shit and doesn't even want to see Mary ever again. Two years later, he maintains this position.

My problem, is that I really enjoy the company of Mary. She's fun, she gets me, and I've confided in her quite a bit. Here recently, Mary and I have reconnected a bit. So I've been hanging out with Mary kind of behind Chris' back. 
So after all that, my question is, is this wrong? I'm not planning anything sinister here, Mary is just a really chill girl who knows more about me than really anyone else.

TITLE: Reddit, please help me understand the fascination with Star Wars, especially when it's coming from younger people.
POST: This is aimed at people 30ish and younger. I'm mid-20s, geeky and in tune with pop culture. I've seen all Star Wars movies multiple times, and enjoyed them. And I understand why it was such a big deal in the 70s and 80s and why older co-workers go on and on about it. The technology was groundbreaking at the time. But I found the story pretty average, acting hollow, characters not at all developed and dialogues lame. So why is it still so big today?

There are so many newer movies/TV shows that are as good (if not better) and technologically brilliant which people don't give as much credit to. The Matrix trilogy, Terminator series, LOTR, Jurassic Park and Avatar to name a few. *Battlestar Galactica*, for heaven's sake. How can someone prefer Star Wars over *that*? 

And yet, we still have everyone and their mothers reference Star Wars in every setting to gain some geek credit. Still have multiple Star Wars themed Superbowl commercials every year. *Why?*

So next time you see a friend dress up as Vader or a storm trooper for Halloween, or engage in some princess Leia cosplay, kindly ask them about it.

TITLE: Should I call the cops on my thief friend?
POST: Last year was my final year at high school; and while it was a pretty decent finish, I got really fucked over by a friend.

I went to a reasonably rich private school, but despite having its own upstairs cafe, the food was horrible and overpriced. At this point, some of my friends were getting their driving licenses, and would drive to fast food places to get their own lunches. My dad would give me his debit card to buy food since he couldn't always give me cash.

I was stupid enough to lend the debit card to a friend so he could buy me lunch. I gave him the number and account and he'd bring the food+card back within 10 minutes. But one day my dad was going through the bank statements and he noticed someone had taken out over $1000 at the local mall. Guess who? Yeah.

My parents made me give them my friend's phone number and they texted him, saying they were going to call his parents and the police if he didn't pay it back. He owned up and said it was because he owed a friend a lot of money. Pathetic excuse. He also said he was going to pay them back ASAP.

Well, six months later, not a single cent out of him. Should I call the police?

TITLE: Mother's employer giving her a hard time to take vacation days (FL) advice?
POST: I posted this in r/legal but I thought I might get a better response here. 

My mother works at a small family owned pharmacy in Florida as a pharmacy technician . Whenever she requests to use her vacation days it is always a huge ordeal.

Recently, my mom requested vacation days so she could be with my cousin who is coming from out of the country. The manager called her into the office and asked her to work weekends to make up for the days she is requesting. That is unacceptable, these are her paid vacation days that she hasn't used for the year. She declined and the manager insisted that she work at least half days on the days she is requesting. 

Throughout the year, every time my mother has requested to use her days she has been denied or the days have been rearranged in a way that is convenient for the manager and inconvenient for my mom because she is given no choice.

Last year, it came to the point where they didn't allow her to take any days off and gave her a check for the remaining paid days off instead.

Essentially they are not allowing her to take her time off and paying her for it instead without giving her a choice. I don't think this is ethical.

I would like to know if there is anything that can be done or if this is even legal. 

There is no HR department in this company, all of the issues are handled by either the manager or the vice president (who are related).

I've been sending her provocative messages, calling her just because, and most notably I've started going to the gym again because I want her to be impressed with my super toned Bruce Wayne body.

It was going great until I hit back day and I decided to do deadlifts. I noticed a slight tightness in my lower back near my hip, but I ignored it because gains.

TITLE: How do I keep my dog from running away?
POST: Fellow Bacon-lovers, I need your help.

I rescued a dog from a local shelter about 5 or 6 months ago, here he is making his [derp face]  His papers listed him as part Golden Retriever, part Australian Shepherd and he's now about 10 months old.  He settled in as a member of the family, my wife and three kids love him to death.  

Unfortunately he has a nasty habit of darting out of the door or gate if given the opportunity, even pushing past me or the kids a few times.  And when he gets out, he's gone.  He's disappeared for a couple days at a time, though I think that was mostly because the people who found him wanted to keep him.  He doesn't appear to go very far when he gets out, but we live in a pretty dense suburban area and we've never been able to find him before it gets too dark to continue looking.

He seems to have a pretty high prey instinct; he tries to chase rabbits and birds when we go on walks.  He's also highly energetic, we walk him at least once a day, sometimes more, as well as trips to the dog park as often as we can.  I've even purchased a Walky Dog bike leash for him that I've used a few times.  I'm not sure that we can commit to any more activities with him with our busy schedule.

So, has anyone else experienced this, or have any suggestions for how to keep him from running out every chance he gets?  I'm worried one of these times he'll get into a major road and get hit by a car.

We're currently considering:

* Obedience classes (expensive and I'm not convinced will solve the issue)
* Invisible dog fence (expensive)
* Shock Collar (eeesh)
* Giving him away (awwwww)

As a rule I'm against causing any harm to him, but when it's a choice between him getting hit by a car, or some Pavlovian love, I may have to break that rule.

TITLE: TIFU by telling my boyfriend I cheated on him.
POST: This happened a few months ago but another post here triggered my memory so I thought I would share.

My boyfriend is in the army and he's gone all but 4 weeks out of the year.  This type of situation is entirely new to me and I was pretty surprised when I first found myself wanting to be in a LDR.  Anyway...  

He was doing army stuff ""in the field"" (I still have no idea what that means) and was having to stay up for all hours of the night.  At this point, he had been out there about a week and was sleeping anywhere from 1-4 hours a day in small intervals.  

We texted when he had time and conversation helped keep him awake when things got boring.  The fuck up happened around 5 in the morning after he'd been fighting sleep for at least 4 hours.  He started texting me that he almost fell asleep and something about how he'd like it if I helped keep him up.  

Me, not thinking because it was 4 am where I live, had the brilliant idea of texting him, ""Lol.  I almost thought about texting you that I cheated on you or something.""  At the time, I thought that would shock him awake and we'd have a good laugh.  However, he didn't see my clearly misplaced humor and I got the lecture of a lifetime.  

""Why would you say that?!?!  I thought I'd get a funny picture or we could sext!"" was his completely understandable response.  I then spent a solid 2 hours telling him I was joking around and would rather beat myself with a sack full of feisty weasels than cheat on him.  He told a few of his friends once they woke up and they mostly (and rightfully) think I'm loonier than the Animaniacs for texting that.  I did manage to keep him awake, though.

TITLE: Best friend (25 M) had unrequited feelings for me (25 F) for a year. He moved on and now I have feelings for him.
POST: My best friend had feelings for me for over a year, which I was unaware of at the time because he never made a move. Well, I suspected a couple of times that he might have a small crush on me, but tried to avoid it due to a past relationship with a best friend ending poorly. 

Once I entered into a long term relationship with someone else, he stopped talking to me. I partially blame myself for losing contact because I was busy with a new relationship, school, and work. Also, a while later a couple of friends told me that he had feelings for me during that period and thought I knew. I didn't have much dating experience at the time and am a very friendly person (often confused for flirting) so I had a hard time recognizing subtle hints.

I ended my first long term relationship due to my SO not having certain qualities that I now realize are important to me. I am now realizing that my friend has all of those qualities, however he is in a relationship with someone else. I initially thought he was in a happy relationship and tried to keep my distance because I wanted him to be happy. However, I work with him and he occasionally describes how unhealthy his relationship is and has tried to break up with her a couple of times. We are not nearly as close as we used to be and I really miss our friendship, but can't tell if he isn't hanging out with me anymore because his GF is jealous of his female friends or if he just doesn't care to be my friend anymore. 

He has asked me for advice on his relationship, which I try to avoid commenting on because I know my opinion is biased and wouldn't want to influence his relationship.

I don't know if I should keep waiting around, if I should somehow distance myself more from him, or tell him I have feelings for him (which seems like a bad idea).

TITLE: I[18M] heard something extremely unsettling about SO of one month[19F]
POST: I've been seeing this girl from work (restaurant, if it matters. Refer to her as C) for around two'ish months now, dating for around one. We don't tell most people from work that we're dating just to avoid problems, as some other people we work with have had issues recently and its been a real shitstorm. The people we hang out with outside of work know, as well as four or so more people.

 Its been great so far, we hang out a lot, get along, etc etc, but before we started dating, and soon after we started, one of her good friends(also works with us, so we're cool as well) mentioned that he didn't like how much she was talking to her ex. I don't know the guy, but evidently hes a real shit bag, her parents hated him, all of her friends hated him, you get the gist of it. At first, I just shrugged it off, even though it bothered me; I'm not going to tell her who she can or can't talk to, as we aren't too serious and at the moment I didn't really know where the relationship was going. 

Another coworker, N, who I trust, told me that C had been talking with one of her friends about her ex, and that friend had come to her. The friend asked if she was still talking to the ex, to which she replied, ""Well, I shouldn't..,"" the friend asked if she would be getting back together with him when he gets back in town, with the same answer. This bothers me, like a lot. Took a little while to realize how not okay I actually am with this, and just basically need some advice or insight. I'm definitely going to say something about it, and I already thought about just breaking it off.

So basically me and my girlfriend of 7 months broke up a few weeks ago in a pretty messy breakup but now I want her back, I've expressed this to her and she says that for now she just wants to be friends but that her feelings towards me may change in the future. I believe there is a chance of us getting back together but whether that's just wishful thinking or not I don't know.

I'm considering writing a letter to her in a couple more weeks basically saying that I'm sorry for what I did (i was a dick to her towards the end of the relationship, I didn't mean to it was a mistake but hey-ho) and that i hope she can give me a second chance. I can't decide whether this would be really creepy instead of romantic and whether it would just push her further away.

POST: So, stay with me here.  I put my HR monitor on and measured the amount of calories I burned while just sitting in front of the TV and it said I burned around 80 - 100 cal in an hour.  I then used my HR monitor for a half hour jog and multiplied it by 2 giving me a total of around 300 cal/hr.  If MFP already takes into account my resting calories burned to give me my daily goal, does that mean I should be subtracting my resting rate from my calories burned during a workout?  Sorry, this is harder for me to explain in writing, but essentially, if my HR monitor says I burned 300 calories in an hour, shouldn't I subtract the 100 I would have burned doing nothing (as MFP has already counted those calories burned) and only log the additional 200 calories burned?

We have touched each other as well as oral but even then I don't feel like these occur as often as I'd like. We don't talk about anything sex related because it feels awkward for her.

We would have a really good week, one where he was busy, one where he would ignore me, one where he would break up with me, and then the next we were back together. For two years. I'm not really sure what happened but 5 months ago I said that I was done and he agreed. We haven't talked to each other since.

Overall, I'm over him. I don't feel heartbroken. I don't feel sad. I don't cringe thinking about him with another woman. I don't care. I just still feel like ""he's around the corner"" even though he hasn't tried once to contact me. I guess I feel like he let go of our relationship so easily when he normally springs back and comes up with some excuse on why we should get back together. He emotionally manipulated and gaslighted me our entire relationship. He was extremely selfish and I took him back every time.

I hardly see him due to it being a long distance relationship so I want to make the most of the time we have together, but he is stubborn and saying he doesn't want to do anything today and that he just wants to mope etc.. however that is making it a bit awkward for me as I have already said it will sort itself out as have my housemates, but it will take a little time to be back to normal.

Basically how do I say he needs to forget it and try and enjoy our time together and actually go out and do shit and have a good day and not let this ruin the little time we have in a way that may actually work?

TITLE: I [25M] have a female friend. My [25F] wife does not like, but I refuse to stop. Am I so wrong?
POST: My wife and I have been married 5 years. We're both 25, and we both are starting to feel like different people. In a good way! But still. 

Recently we've had a bit of a rough patch, for the first time. I told her if things didn't improve we should probably get a divorce, since we owed it to ourselves to be happy. We both agreed we wouldn't give up, and try 110% to improve our relationship. So far things have gotten seriously better. BUT.

We're moving to another state, where an old mutual friend lives. We both added her on facebook and we both talk to her.

Turns out, she has changed a lot. Seriously, if she was a dude we would instantly be best friends for life. We've chatted here and there about moving, our lives and stuff, and we've been constantly having these ""what? you too?"" moments where we realize we're both into the same really obscure stuff (music, ideas about life etc). Areas where my wife and I are total opposites. I never get to talk about this kind of stuff with my wife, and I really, really enjoy it.

My wife noticed how much we talk, I'm not hiding anything we talk publicly on facebook and she has all my passwords. She said it bothered her that we talk so much, and wants me to cut off contact. I basically told her no, because we don't talk about anything inappropriate and I refuse to be controlled like that. I seriously have like no friends and this is important to me. She was upset and we're not talking right now. 

Do I find her attractive? Nope. We're honestly just friends. 

The way I see it, we either agree on this or we'll divorce, and that is just how it will have to be. I'm hoping she comes to terms with her feelings about the matter, and lets go of her jealousy. 

Am I really wrong? Am I failing to see things from her perspective in a way that would change my attitude?

TITLE: Me [18F] with my girlfriend [17F] I brought up an open relationship, but having second thoughts.
POST: I've been with my girl for a couple of months (we've been on and off for a pretty long time now) and we're both going off to college soon. She's going to school in Ohio, and I'm staying in Jersey. We've already both decided we want to continue this relationship in college as a long distance thing, so there's no doubt about that. 

I've been browsing around Reddit and saw a lot of people trying open relationships, but I didn't know if I wanted to try one myself. So I talked to her about it, and she said she'd be open to the idea and it's something we should at least try. Before we talked, I told her this was entirely hypothetical and I'm not okay with doing it, but if we were to do it, we made a set of rules and all. 

I've thought about it a lot. I love this girl, and seeing her with another guy would completely crush me. I'm the only person she's actually had a serious physical or emotional relationship with, and I don't like the idea of her doing any physical stuff with other dudes. 

What should I do about this? Am I being overprotective?

TITLE: How to help GF's parents make friends so she'll feel comfortable moving out?
POST: My (26F) gf and I (25M) have been dating for close to 6 years. The first two while we were in uni, 2 years of us basically trying to figure out life (job hunting, switching etc), and 2 years of having a lot more things figured out on the path to settlement.

For me, 2 of those years was living near campus, 2 years at home with the parents, and then 2 years away from home (1 year about an hour away from the GF, 1 year and currently a 5 hour drive from GF).

For her, she has always lived with her parents.The university was close enough that she didn't need to move out. Now, that isn't to say she isn't independent. She takes care of all the finances, shopping, housekeeping etc at home, but her parents are in good physical health to do this on their own.

So here's where the problem is. I am living quite a bit ways away, but willing to move closer back (sort of giving up a job I love, though might get laid off soon) if her and i moved in together. She'll often mention how she wants to do it and talk about what it would be like. But when I get serious about it, she always brings up how her parents would be lonely and depressed if she wasn't there. Fair enough (I argued we'd move at least an hour away from them so that the distance wouldn't be insane, but no bite)

So now, I'm wondering, with parents that are ~45-55ish age range, and Indian in a community that is predominately Canadian, how can I go about helping her parents make friends?

I was sitting in class browsing TIFU when i came across the post about the guy who thought it would be a good idea to chug a bottle of hot sauce during an interview. After reading it me and my friend couldn't stop laughing, and as soon as we stopped laughing one of us would giggle a little bit a we would just start laughing hysterically to the point where we had tears in our eyes. Since we were suppose to read that lesson and everyone else was completely quiet we decided to try to force ourselves to stop. This is where the FU occured. In order to stop laughing we googled ""starving african children"" to make us sad instead. It didn't work and we just kept laughing. That's when our teacher came up behind us to see what we were giggling at... To him it looked like we were laughing at the children. He gave us a look of pure disgust and walked away before we could explain ourselves. Needless to say I wont be browsing reddit during class again any time soon...

TITLE: Does it matter if i have a planned vacation in the near future when applying for a job?
POST: LE BACKGROUND:
I started at a very well established clothing store when I was 18. It started as part time for the first year because I was also going to university. After I finished my program I began full time hours at my work, got promoted to shift leader 6 months later, shortly after that I was promoted again with discussion of me eventually moving into a Store Manager role when we build new stores.

THE PRESENT:
I am 21 years old, currently assistant manager. I have been considering leaving for almost a year for many reasons and Im under a lot of pressure right now to stay. The company is expanding and we are opening two new stores in the area in May, and it is expected of me to either move up in my position or transfer/ help take on and set up the new two stores.

Now, my job isnt terrible.. all the time. Its actially pretty chill and my coworkers/staff are amazing. But for the position that I have and the amount of work, god-awful scheduling and just plain old stress I have to endure, I am not getting paid nearly what I should be. (Big company,  they dont like to pay anything if they can avoid.) 

In addition, I have just discovered my favorite store is hiring and the job is closer/pays more.

THE DILEMMA:
I have planned a 10 day long vacation for April for my SO's bday. Also I have discovered a job opening perfect for me thats closer and pays more.
So, if I leave my job now I am assuming the new job wont be happy about my upcoming vacation being so soon.
On the other hand, i don't want to pass up this opportunity and have to stay at my current job/settle for something else later on.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [21 F] of 1 year she tested positive for herpes #2 a few days ago. I'm lost.
POST: First off - this is a followup to a post that i made yesterday. That was more in anger then anything so i'm re posting this. 

The basis of the last post was that I read a chat from my GF's EX and it said that he had herpes. My GF never told me about this and never planned on telling me, she had about 2 weeks before i confronted her to tell me. I made her get tested and she tested positive for #2. The shitty part is that I dont think she had any intention of telling me. She said she never had any symptoms, so she assumed that her EX got it from his new GF.

Her ex and her haven't done anything in a year +, probably closer to 1.5 years. I honestly didn't dig too deep. They were together for 5 years. However, he has it and so does she (she assumes she gave it to him now). She said that she NEVER had an outbreak and if she had something that worried her she always went to get it swabbed. She had done this at least once in our relationship so i believe her. 

I honestly don't know what to do here, I lost my virginity to this girl at 25 because i was always so worried about STDs when i was younger. I trusted her to be clean and nope (even after testing), she wasn't. 

In the short term - I'm going to turn our current relationship into a sexless one for now. No PIV till I get tested, but i may give it another week or two to be safe. Is this a mistake? I mean, I really don't even know how i feel about this whole situation. 

Has anyone had to deal with this type of situation?

POST: I feel completely lost. My boyfriend and best friend of 6 and a half years has just broken up with me out of, what feels like, nowhere. 

We were high school sweethearts, went to uni together, survived all that and 6 months ago moved 400 miles away for an amazing job he got offered (UK). 

I've found a great job that I love, started to make some pretty good friends and we have an amazing house together. Everything seemed perfect and I was looking forward to this fresh start together. 

3 weeks ago he just said he didn't know how to feel any more. He'd been down for a couple of weeks but always said his job was stressing him out (he does have a pretty stressful job for a new grad).  He said he still loves me but not in the same way he used to and that things just don't 'click' any more.

I've given him space over the past few weeks but we live together and can't afford to move out and none of the friends we know here are in a position to offer either of us somewhere to stay. 

He's my best friend. I've never got on with anybody as well as him. Over the past few weeks we've been getting on really well, considering everything, and it makes me happy that he seems happier and calmer. He unfortunately bottles up his emotions for too long and can just blow/break down at times. 

I'm scared about the future. We have 6 months left on the lease of our house and moving on fills me with dread. 

I still love him with all of my heart but I understand that if that's not what he wants, I can't make those feelings come back. 

A couple of weeks ago, I went out with friends to cheer myself up, a guy ended up feeling me up in a bar and then tried to follow me home. This makes me even more depressed about the future!

I'm just looking for a bit of support really. I'm struggling to talk about this to friends and family so I'm hoping you wonderful internet people will be able to help me!

I fell head over heals in love with this girl sophomore year and now being in college (we attend different university's a state away) I have an urge to explore different things. 

She is a good girl and I love her very much but I'm tired of a relationship. I want to be able to depend on myself 100% for a while. I feel like an asshole when I say that but I don't know how else to say it. I've actually tried to break up with her twice but I am such a softy, I can't take her bawling and being in hysterics when I say I want to take a break or be separate. I don't have the guts to end it.

She doesn't really like my friends and we constantly fight about me going to hang out with them too much (different now that we are separated). I feel like I am her only friend. She has plenty of friends she likes but she would rather have me than all of them and I do not think the same way.

I don't know what to do right now. I catch myself thinking about being single and how I am too young to be feeling like I'm married. Being with her is all I know I feel like. I want to do me during college and figure myself out because I feel as though I will end up being less of a man than I am capable of. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm being a dick but it's just how I've been feeling. Thanks

TITLE: My [25M] friend [25F] started talking to me differently after recently breaking up with her [23M] boyfriend. Unsure whether she's making a move.
POST: We have been quite close before, we usually video chat when we have problems, usually relationship related. I don't know whether she's sad over her break up and just wants to  have someone to talk to, or she's making a move on me. Should note that there is <1% chance of us being in an official relationship, because we currently living in different countries, and I just broke up with someone because of distance. Here's a list of some of the things she said to me.

She broke up with her boyfriend a few days ago, and sent me a text to tell me about it. She said she was pretty sad, but she's gotten better.

I told her I recently broke up with my girlfriend myself (on good terms, we broke up because we didn't want a long distance relationship but we still care about each other), and she told me ""you can't be with one person forever"" and ""take an opportunity"". She said that since we're both sad and single, we should start talking to each other more.

She told me to use Snapchat to send her photos about ""everything"". We ended up Snapchatting whole night.

She will be in town for a couple of days then she has to travel to another country because she has things to do, and she asked me out of the blue to come with her (unsure whether she means it).

Since she will only be able to see me in a couple of days, she said she would spend all the time with me.

I'm currently at the point where I'm just there for her as a friend to help her feel less sad, I'm not showing any sign of interests or indication that I want to have a thing with her. I'm just quite bad in reading girls intentions in general. We've been friends for over 10 years, we've never been involved though I did like her 10 years ago, but she freaked out about it then and rejected me. We just laugh about it nowadays.

She went outside and saw that the next patient had come an hour earlier and she thought that maybe she got our times mixed up until she checked the schedule andc saw that she placed them an hour after me. She told me that unfortunately I would have five minutes to wrap up because I would have to come back later, although it was **my** appointment time.

She gave me a rescheduled appointment but I don't know if I'm going back because it's a 40 minute walk from my campus. I usually don't mind but it's so hot and I don't want to do that walk twice today.

She's been really great at helping me with my PTSD and overcoming my sexual abuse, but I feel that this was incredibly  unprofessional and it made me feel like what I was saying didn't matter.

Last weekend we were on a band trip and one night we were playing some drinking games in my room and once people had started leaving and it was only like 5 of us she had been increasingly more physical towards me (just holding hands and general closeness nothing major.  That night she voluntarily (hers was right next door) slept in my bed and we cuddled all night (which happened to be about 4ish hours since we had a ride back at 7am the next day.

Last night I talked to one of her close friends(Girl B) about what happened (she was in the bed with my room mate) and how I thought I might have feelings for her and if they were something that has a chance leading somewhere.  Girl B said Girl A said I was cute but was also confused because she likes some other guy and doesn't want to mess things up with him if she has a chance but also is just confused about me as well.  

Girl B suggested I just try and talk to Girl A but I am also confused because I am generally a shy guy and can get really awkward and have big fears of rejection.

TITLE: Me [20s] with my SO [20s] I feel like he is unwilling to compromise for me
POST: Hi, I'm going to try to keep this as anonymous as possible. I've been with my fiancé for a little over 6 years. We are generally very happy. 

We had talked in depth about moving to a big city, where I applied to jobs for him and set up everything so once we got jobs we would be good to go. However, he told me he would be moving only for my benefit and didn't really care much for the city I loved. 

So I said okay, we would revisit the idea in a few years. Until we moved to our current apartment, I have had a dog for the last 15 years. I love dogs and have really felt so empty not having one! I'm a responsible pet owner and am good with training, so there are no behavioral issues of any kind. 

Our current apartment is freaking awesome. It's in the non ghetto part of the city, bright and beautiful with plenty of space and the rent is low. (650 for a 3bedroom with hardwood floors!!!) 

My fiancé wants to stay here because he loves it here, and so do i, but I think daily about having a dog and am always looking for pet friendly apartments. 

He is easily stressed about money and wants to stay because of the low rent, and I keep trying to get him a higher paying job but he's clueless/lazy. He has a couple of years of direct experience and graduated from a really good uni. He also doesn't like his job and complains about it all the time.

So basically in my eyes, he has said no to a move I thought we were both on board with, and said no to finding a dog friendly place, and no to trying to better his job situation and alleviate his stress. 

I can't tell if I am asking too much and am in the wrong, or if he is just refusing to compromise with me. Who is in the wrong?

Okay, I haven't been in a relationship in a while and this one has come on serious and fast. This sounds stupid but I just need to talk this out Reddit. 

Backstory: Bf and I are emotional people, I'm a talker - he tends to shut down. It makes for awkward times when one of us is upset. 

Boyfriend got mad at me the other evening because after a long day we were both grumpy yet still had a commitment in the evening. He asked for his sake if I could stay awake and happy and make the rest of the evening enjoyable. I told him I would try but I tend to completely check out when I'm absolutely exhausted. Later, he got mad that I ""couldn't be happy for him"", he just seemed to believe I was pouting and the more I tried to explain myself, the angrier he got. He finally said that he cares for me so much that if I am not fully happy, he can't be - and then he starts to resent me for it. I'm of the disposition to where my partner's mood affects me but instead of getting mad at them, I try to bring them back from it. I thought we were okay, so I started joking around (you know, light pillow talk before bed), he looked at me and just left. In the morning he drove me to work (as part of previous commitment) and seemed a hesitant to make plans, telling me he'd maybe talk to me later. We usually text during the day (but never a large amount since we see each other often) and he has been ignoring me for the past two days. Does he just need space? Am I being punished? I don't know how to handle this. I'm confused. I feel like this is a stupid thing to ignore someone over. We've had worse disagreements and have always come back to each other the day after.

When our relationship first began he was such a gentleman. He would buy me flowers and gifts. He was very eager to spend time with me and wanted to listen to all my silly stories I had to tell. Well now that we have been going out for a while I feel like things have slowed down to a halt and we are in a rut.

   He isn't a gentleman anymore. He doesn't do any of the things I have previously mentioned. There is absolutely no romance whatever, but it also seems like he has just stopped caring. When it comes to sex it is more of ""hey babe want to have sex?"" and that's it. No seduction, no sexiness, we just bang, say good game and go back to whatever it was we were doing before.  I have told him that I need a little romance and I have even given him suggestions of things to do. And every time I say these things he just kinda blows off what I say, like it goes in one ear and out the other.

   
On top of that it seems as if he doesn't even care about me or my life any more. He never wants to come over and spend time with me at my apartment. And many times he will blow me off to spend time with his friends or just to play video games. We hardly spend any quality time together. I have tried to be an example, and show him how to be romantic by leaving love notes, sending sexy texts, cooking him dinner, etc. But he never reciprocates them. Most of the time he doesn't even thank me for the things I do for him. I am not sure what to do, I feel as if I am nagging him, by repeating the same things over and over.

At the beginning it was kinda weird since im pretty shy and shes really outgoing and we only met only twice a week (3 hr class and the lab) but as time passed I got really comfortable with her and we started breaking the touch barrier and flirting a bit.

As weeks passed I wanted to ask her out but me over thinking like always did not but we kept talking a lot in class and sometimes via text. Anyhow like a month ago I looked her up on facebook to add her and saw that she had a bf but had never before mentioned him. I got a bit disheartened about it but never brought the topic up with her.
Last week was our final of that class and after the test we talked a couple of minutes and I decided to go for it and asked her if she wanted to hang out this past weekend but she said that she could not  since she had other finals and had to study (last day of finals is tomorrow) but that I should call her this week to plan something up.

I talked about this to 3 of my closest friends and they pretty much agreed that if she never mentioned the bf I should just go out with her and have fun  and if she brought up the topic that I should be the one to decide on what to do, as in keep hitting on her or just become another guy friend which tbh I have no interest in.

After the date, she commented on the age difference kind of bothering her, and she asked how i felt...i said, basically, since we established that we aren't looking for anything serious, that the age difference is okay with me..

She more or less agreed and we both said we'll just keep it chill, not rush anything, and just take things as they come

But i kind of feel guilty because I'm dating this girl now, and I don't really have interest in her...does that make me a bad person? Like in the past, I've been super shallow with girls and stuff...and I feel like it would be good for me to maybe just try to date outside of my comfort zone, and just try to get on my feet. But because cause she's young, maybe this isn't a great idea, you know?

I kind of feel like I'm leading her on, even though we have both been up front about not wanting anything serious. I feel like it wouldn't be right just to dismiss her based on one date just because she doesn't live up to my probably unrealistic standards.

Should i jump ship, or would it be nutso to stick around and see where things go, even though there isn't much attraction or common ground?

He gave us his business card, wrote his personal number down and told us to call when we were ready.""  I am 20 years old and my brother is 26. We've both taken some classes at a community college but not many. I have never had a large sum of money to put toward my career so I have no idea what to do with it. He never specified an amount but during the conversation he also said ""I paid for you cousins schooling (which was around $12,000) and look at him now."" My Uncle is pretty wealthy so if I asked for more I don't think he would turn me down, just be proud.
My mom lets me live at home for free and  made my brother start paying rent when he was 25. Although it's embarrassing living with your mom, it's also means I'm living rent free for 5 more years. Her and I get along and she understands that living with her only now only helps my future. 

I'm interested in a Mechanical Engineering degree but have no idea how to go about it besides just plucking away at General ed until I can transfer to Sacramento State. Should I just keep doing that? or? I hope this is enough information and the question is direct enough.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7+ months and things are going downhill and they need to be fixed. I have identified the problem as me being too much of a ""nice guy"". She even told me one night when we were both drunk that ""I'm too nice and it gets boring"". And she's right, at the end of the day I'm a doormat. I'm a pushover, I hardly ever get mad, I can't say no, and have trouble standing up for my self. I rely on her and put literally all of my effort into this relationship. Buying her food, clothes, gifts, etc and giving her everything she wants/needs while I get almost nothing in return.

Now my girlfriend has taken advantage of this and manipulates me. She's generally mean to me and never used to be like this because she knows she can without suffering any consequences.

POST: Hi.

This is a throwaway for fairly obvious reasons. I have a ton of reddit friends, and am fairly active on /r/OkCupid. I'd like to have some privacy.

I just went on the second date with a really, really awesome guy. 

I messaged him first, asking his favorite subreddit. (I searched for users who had ""reddit"" in their profiles).

Our conversation was full of lengthy, interesting messages.

Our first date was at a brewery/pub that is quite famous locally for it's great brews.

I left totally entranced by him. I just wanted to know more. He was intriguing and interesting and interested in ME!

Anyway. I messaged him the next morning asking for a second date. He said he also had a great time, and was excited. We went to a comedy club and got fire-stone pizza afterward. 

Again, the conversation was awesome. I invited him back to my place. He hesitated and said he wanted to get to know me better before ""moving too fast"".

I was surprised, but he asked if he could kiss me (I said yes!) He did. And then we were on our way.

The next day we were texting and he said, ""I need to share something with you before our third date."" 

I was hesitant, but said okay. He said, ""I was not born male. I'm a trans guy.""

I said, ""I'm not sure what that means, but maybe we should chat about it over a pint?""

He said yes, I asked when/where, he gave me a pub and said tomorrow at 7pm. 

What the hell can I expect? I don't... I don't even know.

We haven't talked since we confrimed time/location for tomorrow.

I have been ruminating/freaking out for hours. Am going to bed. Hoping to wake up to some... some help?

TITLE: have I been overly clingy? (20m/20f)
POST: I started seeing a girl about a month ago. We have a lot of common interested like books, video games, politics, etc. So I went on a couple of unofficial dates with her. 3 to be specific. 2 were just us two, one was with her uni friends. We haven't kissed yet.

During the first 2-3 weeks of this, she was really responsive whenever I talked to her on fb, the convo was always good, and she'd always say goodbye with a ""xx"".

She has all her assignments due in the next week or so though, and she's been working on them a lot for the last week. She told me that during this period she doesn't really have a social life. But whenever I try and talk to her on fb, which is every few days or so, she takes ages to respond, doesn't really talk much and doesn't say goodbye with a ""xx"" anymore.

Also, she has never initiated convo over facebook, it's always me. I don't know what to do. Should I push and ask her to hang out again? Or should I just wait until all her work is done and then see if she wants to hang? I mean surely she could take half a day out to see me...

TITLE: Dog almost bit someone when she burst into my house uninvited. Would I have been held liable for her injuries?
POST: This takes place in Texas at a college town. I live in a house my mother owns with only my brother, me, and a roommate that doesn't have anything to do with this story.

The other night my older brother, his college friend 'Mark', and I were hanging out in the living room playing some games and having a good time. Seemingly out of nowhere, the front door was forcibly opened, making it slam into the wall as Mark's girlfriend came in drunk and screaming at him. Immediately, my short-haired pointer jumped off the couch next to me and was 2 seconds away from biting the intruder if I hadn't of grabbed her back leg and held on tight. My brother and Mark proceeded to kick her out and lock the door, not letting her back in. (Also, she drove here drunk, if that's relevant. It's obviously too late to call the police on that.)

Mark's girlfriend has never been to my home before and she was definitely not invited by either me, my brother, or Mark. Mark had told her where she was, but never invited her over either. She came in completely unannounced and started screaming, as she was apparently pissed at Mark for something. Understandable, my dog went into immediate attack mode, as she thought she was a threat with the girlfriend's violent reactions. Otherwise, she's the sweetest dog in the world and loves everyone. 

My question is, would I have been held liable if my dog had bitten mark's girlfriend? Obviously, Mark has broken up with her no and he has texts that say not to come over and he'll be home in a couple hours.

I asked her about this and she was extremely vague, but confirmed it. I don't know anything about this kid or anything more, only that her cousin beat the shit out of this kid after finding them together.

I'm so confused. We were hanging out just before. No fights, no argument. Nothing. All she told me is that she didn't plan this, it just happened, but I don't know if I believe that. The kid is a stranger to the cousin, so she brought him over... I don't know what to do. What do I do? I'm so hurt, I trusted her. She always told me about how she was cheated on and could never do that to somebody. How do I date from here on out? How do I trust someone now that my trust has been thrown in my face?

Obviously this relationship is over. What do I do from here? What can I expect feelings-wise? I haven't cried or gotten angry yet, I don't really feel much of anything right now, but I'm fairly certain it's only a matter of time. Please, someone tell me what to do.

TITLE: Y U NO like sexy pictures??
POST: Okay, reddit.  Here's my problem.  My SO [30-m] and I [27-f] have been together for a little over a year.  I don't remember when exactly, but at some point I started sending him 'naughty' pictures.  He loved it!  I've done it around 6 times now I think, so about once every couple of months. The response became less and less enthusiastic every time.  The last time I sent some, I felt like I was being flirty and sexy and just a bit of a tease since he was out with his friends. But he didn't respond, at all.  When we spoke the next day (he got home after I was asleep), I asked him how his night went, he said it was fun and he had gotten ""distracted"" a couple of times.  Me:  ""Oh yeah..why's that?""  Him: ""Well I got this message while my phone was sitting on the table for everyone to see."" Me:  ""Oh.  I'm sorry, I hope it wasn't annoying or embarrassing."" Him: ""No, it was okay.""    Done.  I said later that it wouldn't happen again and he seemed pretty happy with that.  

So what the hell, reddit?  Why doesn't he want me doing this anymore?  I thought it was sexy and guys liked this kind of thing. 

Problem#2 that stemmed from this.  I'm having a moment of insecurity. I feel less sexy, or at least less sexy to him. But if I talk to him about this and I'm all insecure and needing to be reminded that he thinks I'm sexy, then that just makes me even less sexy because insecurity is about as far from sexy as you can get.  So what's the solution?  I need a little bit of a reminder from him that he thinks I'm hot, but I can't just tell him that's what I need without making the situation worse.   I've even found myself tempted to get this kind of reminder from one of my guy friends.

TITLE: [31/m] am I an asshole for wanting to leave (29/f)
POST: I feel like a total dbag for wanting to leave my wife of 6 years. The only real reason I have is that I don't love her.

I used to be crazy about her, and I want that feeling again of being totally in love with someone, but I dont think its going to happen with her (we've tried couples therapy, reading books etc.). 

I know its not supposed to be sparks for the rest of our lives, but I did think its supposed to be enjoyable, our relationship and sex life have fizzled over time. 

I don't really find her interesting, she doesn't really have goals or feel driven to achieve anything amazing (I am driven and entrepreneurial, want to start my own business soon etc.). When we first got together she wanted to be a wife and mother, and I thought great that lines up with what I want.

With those ticked off, I kind of figured she'd have something after that, but not really. She has a job, but she complains a lot about that too, and to be quite honest she just talks and talks (a lot) and never really has a conversation with me. She gets very angry if I mention this.

She berates me for going to work events, social events, networking etc. which sucks because I love the buzz around that sort of thing.

We are civil towards each other, and can stick it out for the kids. She wants to be romanced but I dont really want to pursue her any more, which makes me feel like even more of an asshole. She's always been there for me, and supported me in a lot of ways, I feel so guilty for wanting to leave. I mentioned a trial separation once and she was furious and said that either its over or we're together.

[Also as an FYI: Part of the catalyst for me wanting to leave, is that I met a coworker about 18 months ago, and we have chemistry. Im not sure if she is in a relationship, but she drives me wild, the thought of even going out with her sets my heart racing, and Im kind of worried that I dont have that with my wife in about 3 years.]

TITLE: My boyfriend [20m] seems to have chosen his Fraternity over me [22F]
POST: We're going on 3 years dating, and it was amazing for the first 2 years. Recently there has been a lot more strain, partly because we were long distance for a while, and partly because he has been spending increasing time at his fraternity and less time hanging out with me. We usually see each other at least every other day, but he usually only wants to hang out if it's at the fraternity house.

As a 22 year old girl, I've already graduated college and work 5 full days a week. He is doing an internship and can pretty much choose his own hours, so he gets upset that I don't want to party every night. He stays up until 2 or 3 am every night, and only hangs out at his frat house. I can't convince him to go out with my friends and me, and he will rarely go to bars or apartment parties. I don't like being at the frat because I'm the oldest girl there by 3 years, and I just think it's really immature. 

I still love him a lot, but it's been ages since he's asked me to hang out in a situation that wasn't at the frat house. I try to take him places and sometimes he'll agree, but he's almost never at my apartment and the only nights we spend together at at the fraternity. He assures me that this is only because classes haven't started yet (our school starts very late) and he is making the most of summer. It's putting a huge strain on me, though, because all of my friends go out on romantic dates and I'm just stuck drinking cheap beer with underage kids in a frat house. 

He's never cheated on me, but lots of girls text him constantly and they're all over him when I'm at the frat. They know me as ""Mrs. *his name*"" so I know nothing fishy is going on, but it's still a little weird to me that he has so many girl friends.

POST: So I got back from my job and found my father asleep on the couch with his laptop open. For details, he's in his mid fifties, has been married to my mom for 17 years, and works a very demanding job in which he is gone from 6am-6pm on a good day. I wanted to tell him goodnight and I saw that the computer was open and when I went to close it I saw that it was open to a casual encounter ad that had a woman looking for a educated man around my fathers age (along with profanity and slang).
  
   I quietly backed away in shock because I didn't know how to feel. I did tell my mom and she went to talk to him after I went downstairs. I listened in and I heard him come up with a jumble of excuses including the name of a male coworker, and the fact that he was just curious. My mom then refuted this with the fact that he went directly to the ad- it wasn't totally like he was casually browsing. When she told him he would be sleeping on the couch- and he asked why- she said that his face explained it all. (Of course I couldn't see).

      What I'm asking here is if he is just curious, or if this could be a sign of something more. They haven't had any disagreements lately and he always is affectionate and loving. He does spend some extra time out after work sometimes but he says he spends it at a restaurant that he does frequent often.

I'm happy to see her leave the phase when she would think that boys/men in commercials and movies looked disgusting, I had sometimes thought it might be unhealthy and a result of her education by my parents. She has a childhood friend (same age) with who she as been watching romantic movies with. they literally choose what movie they will watch based on the male actors looks. 1 year ago I would think that was impossible. ""hot guy"" wasn't even in her vocabulary lol

Today she told me that her colleagues from school /same age) are going to watch 50 shades at the cinema, and that she wants to go too. I told her the movie is about BDSM, and that it is a bad representation of what is good/safe BDSM, and not about... vanilla sex. She understood my point, but said she still wanted to go and believes the ""shock"" could help change her mind regarding this things. 

After that discussion she told me to recommend her other movies that I would consider good (to watch with her childhood friend). I have no idea what movies would be those... I told her to learn about sex a film is probably not the best way, and then said we would talk later.

My boss has always been a dick. He is mean to all employees, yells when things that aren't that important are slightly off, and is a very dismissive person in general. I have never liked him, but today is the icing on the cake.

The boss often brings his older dog in to work with him. She is a sweet dog whom I pet often while working at my desk, and she loves attention. 

Today, I came in at my usual time. Shortly after I began work, the boss came in alone. I didn't think anything of it. On some level I thought to myself ""oh he didn't bring his dog in today"", but as I said I was not fazed. 

We started work at 7:30am.

3pm rolls around. He asks ""Where did *dogs name* go?""

We all reply that we haven't seen the dog all day. He jokes that maybe she has been in the car all day. After which, he goes to check his car. 

Guess who left his dog in the car all day? 

I won't get into the specifics of the temperature, but needless to say, the dog died from the heat. 

I really liked that dog. She was super sweet and nice and getting old and she was a staple of the office.

I don't know what to do I just feel so completely sick to my stomach. I hate him so much for doing that to a poor animal who totally trusted him.

What planet is he living in where he can forget his dog is with him in his car? 

I get it that sometimes accidents happen, but with all of the other awful personality traits he has I just can't even stand to be in that office. The whole day felt like an eternity.

TITLE: TIFU by lying.
POST: Happened a few years back, when I was 10 yrs or so.

I had moved to the Middle East, due to my Dad getting transferred here, and lived in a flat-type system. I only had 1 or 2 friends since no one else in the building was around my age. We all became really good friends after some time since we had some things in common.

To the actual fuck-up now. Being small, I was always curious about one thing or the other, which got the good of me.

My Dad and Mom were going out for regular shopping and all, and I decided to stay back with my friend at my place. As my Dad was in a hurry a bit, he forgot to take a 20 Dinar note he had kept in the shelf along side his wallet, he obviously took his wallet but didn't notice the note kept along side it since he was in a hurry.

Now that piece of money got me really intrigued, I always wondered what if I could get that cash and keep it all to myself! Imagine the things I could do! Me being the little 10 yr old bitch, excuse my self from my friend for a bit, and silently keep the note in my pocket. Mind you it was 20 Dinar(Bahrain's Currency), which is a lot of money.

My Dad is mostly particular about money and when he comes back, he searches for the note in the shelf. He asks my Mom if she knows where it was but to no avail. I literally turned into a pussy lol and was shivering to death inside. I didn't have the guts to spill it out. My Dad kept on thinking maybe he spent somewhere and what not but he eventually gave up.

TITLE: Open relationship: Beginning to feel resentment since I feel l can't have fun. Details inside
POST: So my S.O. (30f) of 6 months and I(27m) agreed on an open relationship (my suggestion). This week I went to a music festival but did not tell her since I didn't want to have her worry that I would be hooking up with people there (its quite a wild festival). 

Once I arrive at the festival she texts me that a close friend of her has died and that she would like to see me for support. Since I lied about what I'd be doing for the weekend I just told her that I was tired and probably staying home for the weekend
 She then became angry at me that I couldn't drive 10 minutes to comfort her (Although on reality I am 4+ hours away at the festival.) 

Now I am heading back to go see her and had to leave the festival early. I still haven't told her that I was away, I feel that it would be worse to tell her the truth at this point. I.can't help but feel resentful since I had been looking forward to this festival for months now and I basically got zero enjoyment out of it since I was worried about if she was OK and also due to her sending me angry texts (Not to mention the total cost was about $400 for tickets, gear, food and transportation). I am now on the bus back and am having thoughts of just breaking it off with her although obviously now would be a bad time since her friend passed.

Am I just an insensitive asshole or a chump? What are your thoughts?

TITLE: [Southern CA] Copyright regarding music video I shot
POST: Around Thanksgiving I was hired to spend a week filming a band as they toured with a very well known group to create a music video for one of the songs that they performed live. The agreed upon rate was $500 which was agreed upon verbally without a contract. (it was a a referral from a good friend)

Anyways, I delivered a final cut in December and basically was met with silence from the group's management. Took me awhile to figure out what was going on; but, basically, the group members loved the video however their label did not. 

So their label went out and had them re-shoot something with some video guys (without my knowledge) and I finally saw a cut of their new version and it's awful (looks like a corporate music video). But, that's not important, what matters is that their plan is to splice my version into their version.

One of the reasons I agreed to the exceptionally low rate was for the exposure as they're gaining popularity. If they're going to create some Frankenstein mis-matched music video that completely erodes my benefits from the project.

And so, since they had not paid after ≈45 days, I emailed their manager saying that I was not okay with this and wanted to re-negotiate terms as I still own copyright on all of my material, had yet to sign anything, and have not been paid.

I'd like to make them several offers... such as allowing them to pay the original $500 and post my original video without any edits. Another would be for a significant increase in my fees if they are insistent upon combining the two videos together. And perhaps lastly, not agreeing to anything if there not willing to pay an increased amount and withholding copyright from them for violation of the agreement.

So is everything I've proposed all within my legal rights? Any suggestions? I'm not looking to be a difficult person to work with, I just do not like being taken advantage of by people with rampant egos.

TITLE: Is there anything wrong with a relationship with traditional gender roles? (Me: 25F Him:29M, together for 1 yr and living together)
POST: Hello there, and thank you for reading this.

My boyfriend and I have been living together for most of our admittedly short relationship. We hit it off really well and both fell hard, and it turns out we have very similar interests, and similar world views. We can just talk all day and he makes me feel wonderful. I love him, and I have no doubts about wanting to spend the rest of my life with him.

 But when it comes to work,he is the one earning the money (works from home) and I clean and cook and make him cups of tea and give him massages and occasionally tie his shoes, and I'm very happy in this distribution of roles. One thing to keep in mind here is that he is physically disabled and can't always do household stuff anyway, but that is not the reason I do this.

I am not a stupid woman or a gold digger, I have a university degree and have worked full time before. But I just really enjoy the role of the demure housewife, it has greatly reduced my anxiety attack and hallucinations, I feel like a mentally healthy human being for the first time in a long time. He is never demanding, always loving, and when I feel down he even cooks for us (even if it's just pizza). 

The problem I face is the values taught to me from my upbringing. Feminism has done a great deal for women, and my mum was always insistent on me being independent from men and earning my own money. She constantly begs me to get a job and I always have to blame my mental health for not getting one, when in reality I enjoy being a housewife. But it leaves me second guessing myself - am I wasting my intelligence? Am I just lazy? Should I just go and get a job already? I also feel like I'm betraying women everywhere who fight for the right to work.
TL;DR: ","A woman is happy in a relationship with traditional gender roles, where she is a housewife and her disabled partner earns money. She questions if it goes against feminism."

TITLE: How do you identify good potential friends?
POST: Season's greetings everyone; I hope you are all well.

I'm (26/F) getting over a break up with someone I really loved and one of the things I've taken from it is that I want a stronger group of friends around me. I've only been in my current city for nine months, so I'm not beating myself up too much, but I've made mistakes with friends in the past and am not sure how to identify people who will be good friends. I have no trouble meeting people, but translating that into lasting friendships? So tricky.

My personal issues to overcome are 1) I'm typically not good at making friends with other women. I'm not sure why. I think I'm scared they'll reject me or we won't have anything in common. I'm trying to work on this. The second problem is 2) many people I thought were awesome friends ended up having romantic designs and weren't really the strong friends I thought they were. The final issue I've had is 3) when I find someone I really click with, I'll do all I can do be a good friend to that person, and I've often found that when push comes to shove they don't reciprocate.

I'm really curious what personal green flags and red flags do you guys have for potential new friends? How do you identify someone who'll be good to have in your life? What should I be on the look out for on my friend quest?

Basically: I am being given control of a trust in my name this upcoming Friday. As a note I thought I was going to be given this control in a year from now, so I'm more rushed than I have intended on being when this happens. 

My parents who have control of the trust currently are sending me a list of the bullion and coins they have in a safe currently. It's not an option to keep it there due to my lack of trust in them. I am willing to spend the money necessary to transport it over, but I understand that I will need to insure it and this might be a whole process.

They've been supporting me while I study, and recently got me early Xmas present tickets to a band I've loved forever, because I couldn't afford it.

POST: So about 2 months ago, I met this girl, Mary in my Biology class. We quickly hit if off and became really good friends. We have so many similar qualities, likes and beliefs. After a few weeks I started to like her and wanted to ask her out, but we both had a lot of AP testing along with work, so we had no time. 

Right after AP testing though, she went to a movie with another guy, and then she kept referring to him as a friend whenever I talked to her. I don't know what to think of that because some mutual friends of the guy and i say that they have a ""thing"".

Its now the last week of school and really the only outside contact I have of her is Facebook. I would love to ask her out but, I want to make sure its a yes before I do.

 See I have a huge problem with confidence because I'm that guy that girls continually see as a friend or reject completely. I have never ever had a girlfriend. I work out and in great shape. I always compliment every girl I talk to. One of my flaws is that I'm socially awkward. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

TITLE: Me [20M] and a girl [19F] I've just met, but I'm unsure about it.
POST: This is my first post on relationships so excuse anything against the rules.

So here's the story. Last month I got on well with a girl, one of my friend's mates, at a uni party, we kept in touch and my friend said that she took a bit of a liking to me. In the meantime I had developed a small degree of feelings towards one of my housemates. Last week however, I got together with this girl, nothing too serious but it confirmed my friend's suspicions that she likes me, so we went out for a drink, chatted a bit, and got on really well.  Over the past few days I've met with this girl a couple more times and I finally decided to ask if this is going anywhere serious, to which she replied ""Well we're not really going out, we're more 'seeing each other'"".  I asked my friends what this means and apparently it's more of a casual thing that we've got going. Not that she'll go sleeping around but that it's not anything too serious at the moment, but there's definitely the chance that it'll develop into that.

In the meantime the one I have feelings for has gone home for christmas, so I have a few weeks to decide on what to do. I'd love to ask her out, but I'm stuck as to what to do with the first one. I like her, but I'd be happier with the housemate. If it backfires I'm left with neither. What would be the best course of action to take on this?

Again, excuse me if I've left out any information or stuff like that, I'd appreciate any advice on the matter and if anyone needs more info I'll do my best to provide.

Thanks :-)

TITLE: I'm cautious about my (29M) new girlfriend (26F) becoming friends with my friends too quickly.
POST: I (29M) have been dating someone (26F) for a couple months and the relationship is going very well. In these past two months we've already met all of each other's friends. She has gone on a weekend trip with me and all of my friends, as well as to a wedding and a couple other social events. 

I found out a few days ago that one of my female friends (Stacy) had invited my girlfriend (Anne) to some sort of girls' brunch with her and a few of my other female friends. Anne declined because she has plans for whatever day it is supposed to be, but it kind of bothered me that Stacy invited her. 

My communication with Anne is very open. When Anne mentioned the invitation to me, I explained to her that even though our relationship is going really well so far, it would kind of freak me out if she started hanging out with my friends because if our relationship ends up NOT working out, it turns into a tangled mess if she becomes part of the friend group. 

Her hanging out with my friends without me (essentially making my friends her friends) is a concept I need to warm up to a bit, and I think it's a little soon for it. I wouldn't go calling Anne's male friends to hang out with them without asking her first, or without her knowing, and if one of them invited me to something, I would definitely ask Anne first if she was comfortable with it. Anne seemed to understand where I was coming from when we discussed it. 

My questions are:

- Is it reasonable to want to have some control over the relationship between my friends and my girlfriend before I'm sufficiently satisfied that my relationship with my girlfriend is ""strong enough"" to last? 

- Did Stacy step out of line by not asking me first if it was okay to invite Anne? 

On one hand, I of course can't tell anyone what to do, but on the other hand I think it's reasonable to expect that my friends and my girlfriend respect my wishes as far as what I'm comfortable with when I'm getting involved in a new relationship.

TITLE: How can I get rid of bad friends?
POST: I am a 23 year old female. I have known most of my friends for a very long time (since middle school). Nowadays all they do when they get together is literally sit on the floor and say awful things about other people. I used to gossip right along with them but it got me into some tight spots and I realized I'm really not into the drama. I'm trying to better myself and focus my time and energy on new hobbies and activities. I have explained to them that I don't want to contribute to their gossip, but they don't seem to want to stop. I don't want to preach at them about how gossip is bad so whenever I'm with them I just sit in silence.  We also don't really have any of the same interests. I like to browse the internet and read and do outdoorsy stuff and they like to party and go to clubs. So, in short, my friends and I have drifted apart. However, they don't seem to recognize this and are sort of clingy. I have started making new friends that have similar interests but I feel like my time is divided between these people that I want to spend time with and my old friends who(m?) I feel an obligation to. 

My real problem is that I feel uncomfortable saying no to people. I don't like to make people mad or to hurt their feelings. I find myself saying yes to hanging out with people when it is really the last thing I want to do. So, my question is, how can I learn to do this without feeling so queasy about it? How can I slowly drop my old friends? I hope I'm not coming off as selfish or conceited or anything, I am just genuinely looking for advice. Thanks for your time.

POST: This is going to be a lengthy post, so I apologize in advance. If it's not an appropriate question, please let me know and I'll remove it. Also, thank you in advance for any guidance, insight, or direction you can offer.

I started reading Reddit about a year ago after I got out of a two year relationship. I took that break up really hard, and it sucked moving out when we made a home together, but I knew that we were not a good fit. Reddit helped me rebuild myself into a better, more confident man as I reentered the dating world. After a handful of dates, I started a relationship again about six months ago. Now that relationship has ended and I'm taking it pretty hard.

I'm just afraid I'm bad at meeting women. I don't really like to go out to bars or clubs much, and I don't know where else to meet interesting women who I might be interested in, and whom will be interested in me. I'm genuinely afraid of being alone forever at this point (as illogical as that is for anyone to fear).

A little about me: I am 23. I suffer from some depression/anxiety that has gotten worse over the years and got severe after the most recent break up. I am currently in therapy getting it treated and seeing about medication next week. I am in a clinical psychology Ph.D. program. I think I'm average looking. I try to be well dressed. I ride motorcycle, cook, into classic film/literature, hit the gym ~5 days a week, bicycle, and I'm starting fencing.

I guess what I'm wondering is, where can I meet women with my busy schedule? How can I make myself more confident and attractive? I'm just feeling a bit lost and worried and I'm looking for any guidance.

TITLE: Retail job(s) dilemma: Stay and wait for bor leave for less pay
POST: Currently, I work at a Goodwill Store - 30 to 35 hours per week. I receive donations and sort them into different categories. My workplace is somewhat hazardous. It's a little dusty in the production room. Sometimes, I need to climb over a half-wall to grab a wood palette and bulk box, and walk along the wall, lifting each over my head to avoid the scratching/breaking the sold furniture. My wrists hurt from carrying and throwing bags and boxes of stuff over my head into piles, in order to keep our pathways clear. My lower back is slightly sore. I have a wicked watch tan, even though I wear sunblock. So, you can imagine that the job is taking a toll on my health. 

I get along with all my co-workers, including my manager. But I'm somewhat stuck as a donation attendant here because 1) we're short-handed in donations, 2) I'm a young(er) male who can lift heavy stuff, and 3) only cashiers (off the record) have been promoted to 3rd key holder. 

I'm interviewing for a position at Target. If I get the job, they want me for the weekends, which I have no problem with, but they only offer 20 to 25 hours. So I may need to have my hours reduced at the Goodwill, or quit the Goodwill altogether - possibly severing my rapport with everyone at the Goodwill since we're already short-handed. Even if I stay with hours reduced, I can forget about any promotion.

Do I take the 20-25 hour job at Target, and risk losing (quitting) my current job. Or do I wait for a better retail opportunity? Thanks in advance.

Side-note: During my time off, I'm studying/coding for front-end web development. The better I get at this, the sooner I can/hope to leave retail.

TITLE: My boyfriend [M19] was diagnosed with ASPD (psychopath). Do you think he could love me [F19]?
POST: We've been going out for 2 years and we live together. The whole time I've known him, he's been very antisocial. He always stays home, never goes out. Lately he's been getting a lot of headaches. The doctor suggested he see a psychologist. After 7 sessions the psych finally managed to diagnose him and now he's being referred to someone who deals with personality disorders.

One time at a party a guy bumped into him and made some condescending comment, my bf just walked away, but he was literally twitching in anger the whole night. Often when we go on dates, he'll just come up with some random persona out of nowhere and literally act like that all night. He'll stop if I ask him to but he seems to enjoy pretending to be someone else. I thought it was just him having fun. I guess it still is, but it just seems so much more nefarious now. These things occurred to me after he told me his diagnosis.

I didn't know what it was when he told me. But we researched it together and he said that most of the symptoms seemed right. He said he used to get into trouble a lot, but he learned how to control his anger and ""read people."" He said he realized he was different early on and learned how to adapt. I have a problem with it because people with ASPD supposedly can't get close to anyone. He agreed and said that he can't get close to anyone, but I'm the exception, that he loves me. I'm not sure what to do. I want to believe that he loves me. I know that he's the same guy as he's always been, but honestly I'm a little scared of him now. I think it's a good sign that he told me what it is because people with ASPD are supposed to have trust issues, but he trusted me with this. I know that he doesn't trust anyone else though. Aggghhhhh. I need some advice.

hard for me. I am at a point in my life where I want a relationship 

with passion and chemistry, and hopefully find the person I fall in 

love with and marry. I feel like guys only want me for a sexual

 relationship and I cannot for the life of me understand why it seems

 that's all they want. I am a very committed woman, and think I bring

 a lot to a relationship, I have a big heart and care a lot about the

 people in my life. I'm confident, ambitious and I think sometimes I

 don't let the guy take the lead, but heck that shouldn't be a deal

 breaker in my opinion. The last relationship I was in was for 3 years

 and the person I was with never wanted sex, and never actually 

loved me or told me he did. It was a very, very, very strange 

relationship so I think I feel like for 3+ years I've not been loved 

very much. I also sort of have a fear of being alone, but equally a

 fear of ending up divorced. My parents never had a good 

relationship and all I want is to live a simple life, with a

fucking white picket fence, some horses, on a lake, and of course 

with a man I love and loves me back unconditionally...

I was upset by this and I avoided her at graduation because I didn't want to put myself or my family in a position where we have to lie to her parents too. My brother said he would ""spill the beans"" to her parents if he met them so I didn't want that either. Now we are in a big fight because we didn't get to spend graduation together and don't have any pictures together because I choose to keep my distance and left early. 

I feel like an asshole for how upset I made her, but at the same time I feel that pretending to be just a friend when I meet her parents, after 2 years of being together, would be very disingenuous. Eventually I want to tell her parents that we have been together for a few years, I don't want to deny the last two years of our relationship and pretend we are just starting to see each other. 

Am I being unreasonable? What would you do?

TITLE: Help buying plane tickets! Time-sensitive, but tight-cashed to boot!
POST: Hey /r/askreddit , I've got an issue buying plane tickets.

So I was watching the prices dip and doge all over the place with about a month to go and Bing telling me to wait a bit (With 67% certianty) that prices -could- drop.

Well, I placed a bad bet and now they're expensive and it would break my budget I set for the trip. I can still afford it, but I don't want to go over-budget and be irresponsible about this. 

Doing some more digging, I found out about Priceline's 'Name your own Price' feature - which can get you shitty flights that get you where you need to go for pretty cheap. Awesome! Flight I need at a price in-budget, what could go wrong?

The timing. That's what.

It's for my wife's birthday, and I have the time off for the day of, and a few days after. Flights I were looking at would leave after I got off work - and have me there by midnight at the latest. 

Well, Priceline's feature clearly guides you in saying that - ""At best, you can pick the day you want to leave, but for the best deal keep at least 24 hours flexible.""

I would pick Saturday, because I have the day already off - but if the flight is too late in the evening I'll miss her birthday altogether!

However, if I pick Friday, and the flight is too early, I'll miss work and upset my boss(es)!

A co-worker suggested, that I ""miss"" my flight if it's too early and go on Standby, hoping that a later flight (That I could make after work) will have seats to take me along. 

Now, this will all depend on the Airline's Standby policy (and I won't know what airline I'm on until *after* the tickets are bought) but its' worth thinking about if it can save me a few hundred bucks.

All in all, I'm pretty sure I'm screwed - but I'm not a frequent enough traveler to know all the ins and outs.
TL;DR: ",OP needs to buy plane tickets for wife's birthday but is tight on budget. Considers using Priceline's 'Name your own Price' feature but timing is an issue. Seeking advice.

I'm a fresher at uni, living in halls. So we all have our separate rooms and share just the kitchen, this kitchen becomes the social hub n whatnot. 
So yesterday afternoon I come back to my hall from a book club meeting to find two of my flat mates asleep in the kitchen. I say hi, grab a drink and sit down at the centre table. 
For some reason, the sound of people sleeping also made want to sleep, I feel asleep on the table. I wake up thinking 'why nap on the table when I can nap on my bed'

I get up, my leg is dead but fuck it my room isn't far away. I walk two paces and my dead ankle gives way, I fall and my flat mates wake up pissing themselves laughing. 

Turns out I fell funny, sprained my foot and now limp everywhere. Flat mates now call me peg leg.

There's this drop dead gorgeous brunette that works at a local bank, that I go to for work a couple times a week. We smile and chat with each other here and there, when I pull up to the drive up window, but its only a few minutes here and there.

Im always choking after I get my stuff back, and wind up driving away angry at myself. Every.Single.Time.

she gives me my receipts back, tells me to have a nice day and walks away, I feel awkward trying to get her attention to ask her, and keep trying to find that moment where it can fit in at the right time.  The days where I do go, all confident that Im going to, theres always something, like other customers so I have to deal with someone else, or she starts to help and then someone else comes in to finish because the phone rings. 

I sit there , reciting over in my head ""hey, would you be interested in grabbing a drink one day after work?"" Or anything else similar, then its just Here ya go, have a nice day SpewedFood, and I say thanks you too and leave, and then get around the corner and call myself a pussy. 

And then I feel awkward to turn around and go back there just for the main purpose of asking. or to go there if I dont have a reason to go to the bank

TITLE: Simple stuff: Should I have stayed at school with this girl today?
POST: So for some context, I'm 17 and today I had to got to sixth form for the last period of the day. I head to class and I find out it's been called off because of some confusion which lead to most students heading home thinking no class was on. Well apart from me and a girl I'll call Emma here.

We both had an essay to complete in class, and the class being cancelled was a lifesaver as I hadn't revised for the essay. She's a bit miffed now because she can't go home yet as she has rehearsals in an hour. I've known her for a long time but we've been nothing more than casual friends. 

Anyways, I get ready to head home again and we walk together back to the common room so I can I sign out and leave. As we're walking back I joke about school and work and she's obviously enjoying the conversation. We reach the common room and turns out it's bloody empty as everybody else is either at home or in their last lesson. 

As I'm signing out she reminds she has nothing to do for an hour and asks if I've got any ideas. I don't have anything to do for an hour apart from sit in a shite London commute, but it doesn't occur to me that maybe she wants to sit and talk more. 

Instead I just say ""right, I'm off, see you."" She responds with ""*Oh,* err... bye?""

Only as I'm walking alone in the pouring rain, to catch the bus and do fuck all for 40 minutes do I realise that maybe I could have used that hour with her. Clearly we had a lot to talk about, I could have even asked her to go through some of the work for the essay we had to do for the cancelled class - or we could have just continued chatting.

I'm home now, and she probably just spent the last hour completely alone in the common room waiting for her rehearsals. My question is, **am I an idiot for not staying and talking with her today?

TITLE: [Advice] Fiancé wants to stop having sex four months out from the wedding (kinda)
POST: So my (M28) fiancé (F25) told me two nights ago that although she loves our sex (which does not involve PIV. We're both virgins) she has been feeling guilty about anything that makes her orgasm. She is excited for our sex after marriage, and up until this point she's been wonderfully adventurous and engaged even though she has a lower libido than me.

She's offered to still give me oral and do whatever I still need, but she's off limits. To me, I don't enjoy sex when it's solely about me, so basically we're not going to have any sexual contact for four months.

She really wants me to stop looking at porn too, and I've been onboard giving it up for my own personal reasons, but it seems like the next few months are going to be really rough now.

I guess my only real question is if anyone has been in a similar situation? How they handled going without sex when you have an incredibly attractive SO sleeping next to you and constantly turning you on. How can I stop from blaming her when I want to support a decision that's important to her?

I don't need any advice about dumping her. I don't think we're going to have a sexless marriage based on our sexual activity up to this point. We're both pretty experienced sexually in everything outside of PIV and have had multiple partners.

I also suffer anxiety about things as well. I don't think I have anything to worry about with my relationship, other than worrying that these things will eventually get on their nerves and they won't want to deal with it anymore.

Sometimes I feel jealous of their past relationships with their exes who are still friends. I definitely have nothing to worry about, but can't help the mild jealousy at the thought of them loving someone who is not me, even if it was before we met. I can't help but compare myself to them, who are all attractive and more than likely in better mental health than I am. I never tell my SO about these feelings, as I feel like it's my own shit to deal with and get over. So, how do I stop doing this to myself and get over it?

But I met her at a party about two weeks ago and she was rather drunk and she was going on about how she loved me and how I was her best friend. Now I didnt take it too seriously because she was drunk but when I texted her the next morning to see if she was alright she signed the text off with  'I love you best friend' so maybe she was serious. The thing that confuses me though is that I feel like Im always the one initiating the texting/hanging out. Im always asking her to meet me for coffee etc. So I feel Im not really very high up on her list when shes looking for someone to meet. The other thing is when we do hang out she is usually is texting someone else, its not annoying and I dont find it rude. Its more that she texts someone and I never seem to get any texts from her. 
Am I being super needy, because sometimes I feel that I am. I try give her space but then Im worried about losing her. I just dont know how to balance it.

POST: So 2 weeks ago, we had a talk and she wanted space. She was unsure if I was the man for her future and she was becoming unhappy with things. She thought a break would help her find happiness, and reset our relationship from past issues if we got back together.

She said she needed time, a month or so whatever. I just went with it because I can't change her mind. We said our goodbyes but she quipped ""This is just see you later, not goodbye.""

Anyway, I decided to do NC for the best chance for me to Move-On and for her to miss me. About 4-5 days in, she checked up on me...I ignored. This led to more contact and missed calls. I wanted to completely ignore, but I felt it would be rude. I responded amicably and short.

That was a Friday, and that night she called/texted after the bars to see me. Stupidly, I let her come over. After that mistake, I told her the next day that can't happen again. Which led to her texting a bunch and calling more. I kept it short.

Sunday, again she checked in with me to which my ignoring got her frustrated to the point of anger. I decided to call her and tell her this can't keep being a daily thing. Although it was hard and emotional, thats where things stand.

TITLE: Questions and Suggestions for Credit Card count and Credit Management
POST: I have some questions as I'm considering some advice from my father about credit and credit score.  I've gone through the wiki and while it has confirmed some of the things he has taught me about the topic, I'd like to get a second opinion on the matter of credit card count.

For some basic background, I am rather stable financially, have a solid savings account to handle any kind of emergency, a solid credit score for being in my mid 20's (Mid-high 700's).  I carry only one credit card though and it has a relatively low limit from my local credit union.  I see the advantage of opening up one as it gives another line to report on long term, but I try to approach things from a practical standpoint.  I have my credit card used for only specific things and auto payments set up to pay the balance automatically, and I have not actually needed an additional card because I work hard to make sure that I keep myself in as little debt as possible so from a fiscal standpoint at the moment the issue is to me: I have enough money set aside for emergencies of most kinds that I don't NEED a credit card to handle it, so is it even worth getting a second one?

I'm aware too that I could ask for an increase increase in the limit on my existing card and likely get it with no problem, but then I would want to approach the situation with the mindset of: one card is for general use like I am already doing with specific kinds of purchases, and the other would be there for something bigger, like some large piece of furniture and the like, to which I again cannot forsee anything at the moment where I would want to put down $1000+ on something all at once.

TITLE: I'm in a weird situation with the car dealership
POST: I bought an 06 scion xb from a dealership in my town. A month into having it, the dealership calls me regarding a title issue. Apparently the previous owner put an estimated amount of miles on the title when he signed it over and the auction didn't catch it. When the dealership bought it, they didn't catch it either.  It wasn't until they tried signing it to me that it was noticed and now the true miles are ""unknown"". This puts a red flag on my Carfax and makes my title a box c. Ultimately the value of my car dropped and I can't trade it to a dealer because banks won't finance a dirty title.

They offered me my down payment plus the money I put it in it. Or I can keep it knowing that in the future, it's going to harder to sell.

Of course I asked for my money back, but they were not happy with that. This particular dealership has five lots in my town so the GA drove from one of the other lots to this one to try and get me out of taking my money back. He offered me cars at the same price(literally driving me to every one of their lots), or cheaper ones I could pay in full with the amount of money I put down. I was consistent with wanting my money back. He got real pissed, made some phone calls, and ended with the idea that they would be allowed to pay me 1,505. Thats 15 cents per mile I drove it plus a $195 detailing ignoring the 380 I put into it at the shop. My down payment was 2,000. I told them to keep the check for now. I wanted to talk to the owner.

Now everyone's avoiding me.

In 15 minutes (we watched the clock after 5) one waitress had walked by us 4 times to get to other customers and another had walked by us twice.  We finally got up and just started to walk out.  As we were heading out, one of the waitresses said ""Why are you leaving?""  I turned around and just said ""We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to take our order.""  

I turn around to leave and hear it behind me, in that snarky ass tone from one of them.. ""Well I don't know about you girl, but I never saw them.""  I stopped.  Then I hear it from the other one, ""Yeah, they couldn't have been here long.""  I turn around. 

I walk up to the counter and basically start screaming while pointing at them ""Don't you dare fucking lie like that, you walked by me twice and you walked by me four times, one time you even smiled at me.  So don't you fucking stand there and lie saying that you didn't notice us.""  Then I walked out. 

Still went to lunch there the next day, I mentioned I had crappy service at night to my waitress and she had actually heard about some raving lunatic that came in and yelled at a couple of the waitresses the night before.  I laughed and said it was me and explained what happened.  She just rolled her eyes and said something like ""Yeah, knowing them, I believe you.""
