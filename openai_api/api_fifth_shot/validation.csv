TITLE: How do you get someone out of your head?
POST: Hi,
I'm 22, and I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.

Problem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.

We decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. 

Now, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that. I would like for those feelings to go away, to leave me alone. But I can't.  

What do I do? It's been 3 months now, and I'm just desperate.
TL;DR: ","long relationship; fell in love with an other person; admitted it; would like it to disappear, though it doesn't."

TITLE: So, my mom woke me up with a loud TV.
POST: She was in her living room, watching TV. This was at about 8:30 in the morning, and she was exercising. She turned the TV up extra loud to hear it over her excercycle, and woke me up. I went in there asking for her to turn it down. She said she didn't have to; I explained that I always used headphones so she didn't have to deal with my noise and that she should give me a little more respect, given that I paid rent at the time.

She disagreed. I went back to my room, rather pissed off at the lack of equality. I had no lock on my door; but I had a dresser right next to it, so I pulled one of the drawers out enough so that it caused the door to not be openable. Then, I turned my speakers up really loud and blasted Gangnam Style on repeat, with the bass cranked up as high as it could go.

If you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song. I personally don't mind it. But here's the thing about my bass; it vibrates the walls, making one hell of a lot of noise. Needless to say, my mom was not pleased and shut off the internet. But it was oh so worth it.
TL;DR: ","Mom had the TV on loud and woke me up, didn't care that I'd respected audio levels in the house, so I countered with playing Gangnam Style on repeat with the bass thumping through the walls."

TITLE: My girlfriend (20f) of two years cheated on me (20m) by kissing two guys at a Halloween party.
POST: Lately her and I have been having a few problems, and these problems have been brought up before a few times. One problem being that I don't show enough affection. I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.

For Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.

We both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it. It makes me sick to my stomach. Should I even try to fix it or would I be better off cutting all ties.
TL;DR: ",My girlfriend kissed two guys at a Halloween party and liked it. We love each other but don't know what to do about it.

TITLE: One year post-pregnancy, aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help?
POST: I'll try to keep this short!

**Background**

* I've always been an on again/off again (very casual!) jogger, typically doing 3 - 5 k
* My knees have always been finicky, and I went to a physio who thought I had ""runner's knee""
* Pre-pregnancy, my ""runner's knee"" would flare up when I got to the 8 - 10 k distance range, even if I had a decent base (doing a C210k type program)

**Current Problem**

I had my baby a year ago, so all in all I haven't run for about 1.5 years.  I'm quite slim and have been doing aerobics-style classes for the past year, so I'm not totally out of shape.  Body weight exercises, aerobics, bikes and ellipticals are all fine.  However, when I run even the tinyiest bit, or even go on a long walk or a hike, my pelvis gets very sore and tight, and my knees start hurting very quickly.  I already am doing general squats/lunges/stretching type things.  

I'm starting to feel like running just isn't for me anymore. Which is a bummer, because I really enjoy running!

Has anyone had something similar? Can anyone recommend some stretches or exercises that might help?  Should I see a Dr?  Or should I just see a physio?  Not quite sure how to proceed.

Thanks!
TL;DR: ","I think pregnancy messed with my body, now I can't even run even the smallest amount without pain in my pelvis and knees.  I'm fairly certain the problem isn't just that I'm completely out of shape."

TITLE: TIFU by getting scared for no reason and peeing on myself
POST: (Pre-apology for formatting errors since i'm on my phone)

Well, this was embarrassing and happened a few minutes ago. 
I work at a small law office which shares a building with a few other businesses, a dentist's office and a military recruitment center. There is no drinking fountain in the building, so I bring a giant 2L water bottle which I sip on all day to keep hydrated and counteract all the copious amounts of alcohol i drink (after work, of course). Unfortunately, I have been cursed with a small bladder, and have to go pee sometimes 8-10 times a day. Luckily the back door of my office opens up right near the bathroom, so I can usually drain the main vein without embarrassing myself by being frequently seen there.

As I was wrapping up work for the day, I realized I would have to pee one more time before leaving. It was slightly after 5, so when I walked to the bathroom, I wasn't expecting to see anyone in there (it is the kind of bathroom with a urinal and a stall).

Fuckup begins when I open the door and there is a dude who had just finished shitting and was leaving the stall. For whatever reason this terrified me for a split second and I jumped and gasped. 

The guy was amused and chuckled and was like, did I scare you? I muttered something like ""haha, yeah, a little bit"" and I kept my head down, beelined to the urinal and unleashed the krakan. 

I was super embarrassed and very preoccupied so I didn't notice that the bottom part of my untucked, button-down shirt had slipped into my urine stream and was getting soaked. I didn't realize it until it began to sort of soak back onto my pant leg and getting my thigh wet. 

Well, fuck, i thought. This sucks. Then i remembered my fiancee was coming to pick me up straight from work so we could go grocery shopping. I cleaned up as best as i could, but its still very obvious. Luckily I have a P coat which is long enough to cover my pee-soaked netherregion, so i may get through this unscathed. My girl didn't notice yet...
TL;DR: ",got startled for no reason by a normal dude taking a shit and then pissed on my pants and shirt due to embarrassment and now I have to go shopping in my shame-soaked pants.

TITLE: TIFU by staring too much.
POST: Unlike most tifu's I have seen, this happened today. So, to start off I am 16 years old and have started my second semester as a sophomore, in one of my new classes (team sports to be specific) I noticed a very attractive and genuinely cute girl. I have never been on dates or been romantically involved with any girls before, because I have social anxiety and I am pretty chunky and I have confidence problems because of it. Any way, back to the story, I notice this cute girl and I can't help myself and I stare at her then I gain focus and I am focused back on the game. The day continues normally until I look back and her eyes avert away from me quickly, like when you get caught staring at someone and you act like you weren't staring. So, I thought ""does she like ME?!?"" thought it might have been a coincidence but I caught her stare a few more times. So after we dress back into our normal clothes I stare at her and question. whether or not she could like a person like me. She caught my gaze this time and she turns away and talks to some dude. The dude was pretty weird but there wasn't a day when she wasn't talking to him during class. Anyway the dude gives me a dirty look and the bell rings and I thought maybe she doesn't like me maybe she was creeped out and told her possible boyfriend that I was staring at her all class. So yeah saw her walking away with the dude and I saw her eyes on me again and they avert again. Don't know her name or anything so probably creeped out the poor girl and might get confronted by the dude, also I seem like a total creep...
P.S. sorry for formatting on mobile.

TITLE: Reddit, I think our family dog just consumed a significant amount of chocolate. What do I do?
POST: Okay so my father and I went out to dinner tonight and left the dog at home. I'd left half a bar of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz, still in the wrapper) sitting on my desk. Mind you, the bar has been sitting on the desk for about three days now and the dog hasn't done anything about it, and typically doesn't. She knows not to climb on surfaces and has shown no interest in the candy before. 

However, I returned home to find my bedroom in shambles. The contents of my desk were all knocked around and a bunch of family photos were all shredded and chewed up. I found the empty chocolate bar wrapper on the ground and still can't find the offending candy. I can only conclude that the dog has eaten it.

This is something that my dog would've done as a puppy. However, she's ten now and hasn't behaved like this in years. She's acting fine at the moment, but I'm still worried. My father doesn't seem concerned about her at all, which worries me even more.
FYI, my dog is a dachshund mix and weighs about 25-30 pounds. 
Has anybody been in this situation before? What happened? Does anybody know what to do?
TL;DR: ",I think dog got into chocolate when I was out. My dad isn't concerned but I'm afraid she's going to keel over and die and I don't know what to do.

TITLE: Me and my (former) best friend.
POST: I'm a 15-y.o. female, and I'm pretty sure that I just lost my long-time female best friend (a year older), who has been with me for about 4 years.

I had only two friends in school, and 'she' was one of them. We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.

In the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say ""no"", as always, without looking me in the eye.

And now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done. I don't have much friends. Now that I am in a new university, I could simply forget that part of my past and move on, but I cannot bring myself to do so. You can't just forget years of shared experiences, right?
 

Hell, I even dream about her sometimes. I adore her as a great friend, no less. But in those last few days together, she'd just blatantly ignore me, and wouldn't at least tell me what I've done wrong--and that really hurts me. I'm rarely emotional, but look at me now.

Any help at all would be strongly appreciated. If it's me who's at fault, do tell--I'm open. Apologies for the long post.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to creatively announce my first pregnancy.
POST: This happened a couple months ago. My husband and I spend most of our time working in the overseas, and we recently came home to the U.S. for a year to apply for another long term visa. We decided that we should spend that year trying to have our first baby.

Within a week after making this decision, I realized I had missed my period. The next week I took three pregnancy tests at work, and that's right, my Mexican ass is knocked up. Instead of telling my husband right away, I came home from work and made a cookie cake that said ""I Got Knocked Up"" and a bunch of cupcakes with letters on it that, when unscrambled, say ""I am pregnant."" 

Here's the FU part. Since we spend a lot of time overseas, we don't have many close friends, but we had a few people we had begun hanging out with and I invited them all over that night to play Settlers of Catan. When my husband got home that night, they were all there waiting with the board set up. I brought out the cupcakes I made and told them all to unscramble them. My husband stared at the cupcakes for a minute and said, ""I am pregnant."" All our new friends were super excited, but my husband just sat there dumbstruck.

Finally, one of our friends stopped and asked my husband, ""Dude, are you just finding this out right now? Ohhh Shit."" My husband and I went into our room for about a half hour and he was pretty upset that he didn't know first and we didn't decide together how to tell people, and how he was put on the spot in front of practical strangers. But then we made up, cried, called our parents, and then rejoined our awkward guests for a game of Settlers.

TITLE: Knee pain due to poor balance
POST: I've had difficulty with distance running due to strong knee pain. My endurance is great, I can cycle for very long distances, but I can't run because my knees give out around 8 to 10 mies.
I went to the Orthopedist who did a full series of x-rays and pronounced my knees in excellent condition. Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and ""hip stability"" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.
So, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?

TITLE: I'm (18M) jealous of other guys flirting with my (18M) girlfriend on social media. Help?
POST: My jealousy is starting to become a problem in this relationship. Actually, it has always been. Last year, a boy my girlfriend was friends with had kept walking her to class, writing her cute notes (something boyfriends do) and asking her if she's sure about being with me. I threatened to break up with her if she never stopped talking to this guy, because he was obviously trying to make a move. Now that she's in college, she's hanging out with more guys! 75% of her friends are guys, always hanging out with her, and after the ""friend"" she had last year, I can't stop being jealous or mad about her friends. The social media part about this, guys put heart eyes on her photos on instagram, and I tell them to back the fuck up, and my girlfriend gets mad at me for confronting them! ""You don't know what they meant by them, it doesn't mean they're flirting with me."" I understand that she is right, she doesn't respond back but she obviously likes the attention she gets. My jealousy is also fueled by my friend group. My friends have dated my exes, I've been apart of closed door conversations about how some of my friends want to fuck my other friend's ex, visa versa. I would never do that to my friends, and in my world, most guys in college or highschool just want to take my girlfriend if they hang out with her. Or want to fuck her. She has already encountered a guy trying to flirt, and she gave him her number just to talk when we were arguing and on a break from our relationship. I have influenced her as well to be jealous with how i act with my anger and jealousy, but a big break up caused her to stop being clingy. Now i'm stuck being mad and jealous towards guys around her, and now I feel overprotective.

TITLE: I [22 F] want to buy my bf [28 M] of 6 months a $500 very rare video game for his collection for his birthday/Christmas. Will a gift of this caliber scare him off/ be considered too much after being laid off from his game dev job?
POST: My boyfriend's birthday is December 24th, which is Christmas Eve. He grew up in a foster home and never got great presents for either his birthday or Christmas. He often spends his birthday and Christmas alone because his foster mother is uninterested and he doesn't have a great relationship with his birth mother. 

He spent Christmas with me last year, so I went out of my way to get him both a birthday present AND a Christmas present, both of which valued above $50. However, he was so thrilled to have someone to spend his birthday and Christmas with, he showered me with 5 very nice, expensive gifts. I felt terrible. Happy, but terrible.

He is a video game artist but was recently laid off from his job. He is very passionate about his video game collection. There is one game I noticed in his collection that he only has the sequel of. I asked him why because it is very unlike him. He said it was because the original was wildly expensive and he already had a hard time affording a mint condition version of the sequel.

The cheapest, mint condition version of the game I could find is about $500. I do not make a whole ton of money, but I have saved up enough for it but now I find myself having second thoughts. I would have to buy it now or within a few months because the price skyrockets the closer it gets to Christmas. We haven't been together all that long (about 6 months) and I don't know if it would be right to drop $500 on a present just yet.

I have so many questions. Is this too much? Would it be creepy to get him something that he never asked for? What if giving him a game gives him bad feelings about getting laid off? What if we break up before Christmas and I am stuck with the game? Would the game have the same value to his collection if he didn't earn it himself?

Any help would be great. I am torn.

POST: My boyfriend's been very close friends with this girl for a few years, and him and I have been dating for a year and a couple months now. I've never had a problem with their friendship and I know that it's platonic, they've never done sexual stuff or dated or anything. And she had a boyfriend throughout out entire relationship, but they broke up last Thursday. Since then she has been trying to talk to my boyfriend more and I'm worried that she wants to do stuff with him. I've hung out with my boyfriend twice since and both times he got several texts from her and she hardly ever used to text him while we've hung out before. And yesterday evening I called him and he was talking to her on the phone. All of a sudden since her boyfriend and her broke up now she's constantly trying to talk to my boyfriend? I think she likes him and I don't want them hanging out anymore, when he said he was talking to her on the other line I told him he's not allowed hanging out with her anymore and he seemed angry at me for saying that. Since that I've apologized and we aren't fighting now but I think he still talks to her. How do you think I could get them to stop their friendship without ""telling him what to do""? Do you think that she wants to date him? Or why is she so obsessed with him now that she's single? I'm so upset and I'm worried about what will happen if they hang out with eachother now.

TITLE: My [[22m]] gf [[20]] of six months says things were going too fast and she's not capable of being with anyone right now.
POST: A little background. I met her this summer through her then boyfriend [[28]] of two years, who (as I learned later) treated her like shit, was generally abusive, cheated on her, and used violence on her. They were in a long distance relationship and see each other for about two weeks every two months. A few weeks later I invited her over for my birthday party, we got to know each other better and practically started dating (behind his back that is). Initially I didn't want to ruin their relationship but she said she no longer had any feelings for him and their relationship was going to an end. She broke up with him a few weeks later, when he came to visit her.

Our beginnings were pretty intense. We'd hang out every day, spend most of free time together, see each other almost every day and send dozens of messages every day as well. It came to a point where we practically started living together. About a month into our relationship she said that she loves me. I told her I developed feelings for her as well. We started having sex not so long after that.
Anyway, things were going pretty good for some time, until very recently, when the honemoon phase started deteriorating. I could feel someting was wrong with the way she acted towards me, she seemd sad and unhappy, so today I confroted her about it and what she said is basically that she thinks our relationship came too fast, that she feels bad about chating on her then boyfriend, and that I am a great guy (handsome, intelligent, romantic, good in bed, blah blah), but she thinks what she felt towards me was not love but affection and that this feeling is now gone. She also mentioned that she's used to being with someone significantly older, that I am way too good for her, that she is basically incapable of loving anyone right now and needs to be alone for some time. She didn't exclude being with me in the future though.

What should I do guys? I don't want to lose her, I love her.

TITLE: Me [22m] with my girlfriend [19 F] of 1 and a half years, has been having communication and trust errors as of late
POST: Everything in our relationship up until about a month ago was fantastic.  We never fought, we understood each other and acted like the bests of friends and lovers through it all.  Recently, I went back to school and our communication has been a bit strained, since I didn't do so well in last semester and have been focusing more on my studies.  

Last weekend, I could tell something was definitely wrong.  She was constantly on the phone texting, conversation seemed strained and she seemed more engrossed with her phone and because of this there were problems during sex which made it not enjoyable at all.  We confronted each other and she told me she felt as if she doesn't feel as if we're in a relationship when I'm up here because I don't text as often as I used too.  

On my end, I'm worried because a new guy friend has come into her life and she seems to be putting more time into talking to this guy than to me.  I told her I would change and nothing was threatened in terms of a break up or anything, we both agreed we want this to last.  However, I can't shake this feeling that something is up and the more and more I think about it it makes me more and more paranoid and depressed. 

I just need someones outside opinion before I do anything or say anything irrational. I truly don't want my relationship to end with her, but with all the signs I'm getting, I just don't want to get dragged through the mud for months before something bad happens to me. 

Note-my girlfriend was a lesbian before I met her.  Failed relationships with men and a bad upbringing led her to hate men for a long time and I was the first guy she dated in years.  Doubt this has any relevance but I'm just trying to put all the facts out there.

I did tell him that we would give this ""relationship"" one last try and then just let it all go if it didn't work.

TITLE: I have begun treatment for adult ADD. I feel I have climbed out of Plato's cave. Now that my brain functions at its full capacity, I hunger for knowledge. Help me nourish my ambitions!
POST: A little background information:
My condition was overlooked until now (19) due to a combination of what I assume was my intelligence compensating for the deficit and an aversion to the idea of ADD/ADHD by a great part of my family.

I first became interested in ADD while talking to a friend about her condition and, upon further research, diagnosed myself; however, that is another story.

This thread isn't about ADD and I don't want ADD to be discussed on it.

TITLE: Me (22f) and boyfriend (21m) of 7 years moving in together for the first time across country
POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years this November. We've been together since we were 14 and 15 and have never broken up. I would have liked to live together already at this point, but his parents have a rule that we cannot get engaged, married, or live together while he's in college. 

He's just about to start his senior year of college and he's already got job interviews lined up for the west coast. He would like to work on the East or West coast while I'm hoping for West. We currently live in the Midwest (USA) but in separate houses. We're both concerned that because we've never lived together a move across the country to live together might break our relationship. I suggested that we do couples counseling. I have been in therapy personally for my own issues for about a year and have found it very helpful. We've had big fights in the past where I've brought up couples counseling, but he doesn't want to go because he feels uncomfortable with it and thinks we can fix our problems ourselves. 

I think it would be beneficial to do preventative couples counseling for this school year before we make the big move. He seems slightly more open to it than he has before because he's concerned as well and feels unprepared for the future. We have been through so much together and we're on the same page about big things like religion and children. We have a very solid foundation and there is so much love between us. We just want to be as prepared as possible so that our relationship flourishes when we move in together for the first time. 

My question is has anybody gone through something similar and what would you recommend for us to be successful? Do you think couples counseling is a good idea for us? Please share your experiences and any advice you have! Thank you very much.

TITLE: [24/m] I am that controlling boyfriend.
POST: Actually, I was that controlling boyfriend. I noticed it, but thought that it was just a little phase I was going through because of stress at work, past relationship experience, blah blah blah; but really, it doesn't seem like that was it at all.

It was pretty bad. I'd make mountains out of molehills, volcanoes out of mountains, and could find any reason in my head to think that she was deceiving me. Part of my personality is very analytic and I have a good memory, which didn't help at all. She would tell me about her day or a story from her past, and if something didn't add up I would prod and say things like, ""yeah, but you also said..."" or ""but wait, didn't you do...""

It was bad, all bad.

The worst part is that in my head, I was sure that I was really in love with her and wanted her to have freedom. But in the back of my head, I was worried that deception is everywhere and its never that easy. I would get so sure of myself, becoming condescending while I told her what she was *really* thinking or did. Then, she'd finally get the straight story through to me and I'd start bawling and apologizing. I swore up and down that it wouldn't happen again, but it always would. 

Well, the day after I called about enrolling in therapy, she dumped me. I deserved it 100% and I'm not here to ask how to get her back, because, frankly, it will never happen. But, I'm wondering what experience and insight I can find here to help me overcome this problem. I would like a healthy relationship in the future, but I am completely incapable of having one, as I am now.

TITLE: How do I end a friendship even though they haven't done anything wrong?
POST: I am in a situation that I have dreaded, and since I can't sleep, I figured I would reach out.

I(24F) was friends with a group of guys in college my first two years- it was maybe the social circle I hung out with third most? They all lived in my same dorm community and I was pretty close to one of the guys because of our shared interest in video games. The rest of them I just enjoyed the company of and because they were in close proximity, we naturally would grab meals and hang out in the dorm. I don't think we ever went to any parties or any non campus based activity. I have since lost touch with most of them.

One of them attempted to get in touch a few months ago since we now live in the same city. It seemed like he had just gotten out of a relationship. I told him we could hang out when I wasn't busy with work. He reached out to me again a few weeks ago and I ignored him. I know I probably should have addressed this then. Now he has messaged me saying that he wants to know why the animosity between us and why I'm ignoring him.

He hasn't done anything wrong, I just don't have the desire or social capacity to continue a friendship. I often move from one social circle to the next and will maybe find one person I genuinely want to be life long friends with. I find myself stretched thin just keeping up with that handful of friends. I find most of my time spent with them, my SO and my two sisters, and they make me very happy. Some past friends have figured this out about me, and with others it is a gradual growing apart. I don't know how to handle someone trying to come back into my life uninvited. I also can admit that my concern the first time that he wanted to explore a possible romance opportunity and I was having none of that.

I don't think it makes me a bad person to not continue being friends with this person, but I don't know how to end the friendship without being an asshole. r/relationships, have you ever been in a similar situation? How do I respond to this person?

TITLE: Me [21/F] with my hookup [24/M] recently few months, Advice Hookup: Go after it or stay put?
POST: I've been friends with this guy that goes to college on the same campus as me for over a year. We would always catch up and hang out between classes, and even have some homework nights that would involve wine and getting our work done. I had always had a crush on him but he is so hard to read that I thought I was completely friend zoned.

It wasn't until one night I came back from the bars early and wanted to keep drinking that I asked if he was down to hang out and drink. I went over and we drank, talked and ended up watching episode after episode of a TV show. No moves were made this entire time. Then as it reached the early hours of the morning I fell asleep during one of the episodes and he woke me up to basically making out with me and hooking up.

After this I didn't know what to do so I just sort of waited for him to say anything and I think we were both in shock so I just got dressed and we swapped a few words and I dipped out. Just recently we hooked up again after he came to a kickback I threw and we went back to his apartment with friends to play some drinking games and then I went back to my place only to get an invite to come back down. After this hookup he's the one that left me and told me was only leaving bc he had to be up in 3 hours. But we never kiss or anything after its just put on clothes and awkwardly showing each other out the door.

His friends have been pushing me to go after him and saying that he's lazy in the fact that he can want something but never really goes out of his way to get things. He also has told his friends in front of me that you cant just be friends with girls and also be attracted to them and plan to hookup because it doesn't work that way. So should I try to go after it or just keep it how it is now? My friends tell me I'm the Ice Queen and I don't show enough interest.

TITLE: Me[18F] with my partner [18M] together 1 year, thinking of moving in together
POST: We've been considering moving in together. We've really been growing in to our relationship, and despise our age have matured into it. I've had a lot of struggles through the year - including my father's death. He has not left me, or avoided me, but he supported me through it all.

We're both studying a bachelor at university (first year) - he has a decent paying job (about $400 a week), and I've been getting temporary jobs here and there (Currently working 2, and earning $500 week). If we register our relationship officially and move in together, we will both be eligible for about $400-500 of government assistance each. 

We are both ready for the challenge, and one way or another I am moving out of home. We won't be moving out until December-January, earliest. I will hopefully have a more permanent job, consistent.

I'm seeing a lot of positives to moving in together, it may help develop our relationship further and build a life. We're certainly not ready for kids or marriage or anything. Just moving in together, into a small house/flat for rent (which is pretty cheap in our town, I've looked into it).

So, money aside - I'm really focused on the good points, and I'm hoping I'm not overlooking a crucial point. Is there some dead obvious reason not to move in together? Or any good advice on handle the situation, assuming it does go through? Or good advice for figuring it out.

I want to move in with him. I want to cook with with him, and fall asleep beside him every night. I want to drag myself home after work, and have a cup of tea with him. I want to have those moments where one of us get grumpy because our assignment is due and it's not finished until 11.34pm... and the other stays up late enough to read it through that one last time before it's submitted. I want us to sort out our problems, make decisions together, and know we're in this for each other.

My Grandma wants to reconcile and clear the air, but my aunt won't go near her, won't let her husband (G-ma's son) and kids go there, and avoids family events.  My Grandma is almost 85-- and I think this is rediculous.  Why waste time the time you have with somone?  Why continue to hold a silly grudge?  To complicate matters further, my grandma has a daughter who lives with her and likes to be in other peoples business-- I think she is also part of the problem here as she won't drop it either.

TITLE: Reddit, help me name a student-funded scholarship
POST: Hi reddit.  I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:
Each summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.

So, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.

OK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:
Nonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),

Social and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,

Triple Bottom Line Fund,

Socially Responsible Internship Fund.

See, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.

TITLE: Not sure how I (24/m) feel about girl (22/f) that I've been dating for a month
POST: So I've been dating this girl for a month and on paper we are perfect for each other. On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.

However I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:

a) Am not really that interested in her. 

b) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. 

c) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.

d) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.

e) All of the above

POST: So I recently found out I have scabies on my legs and stomach. 

I made a doctors appointment for treatment next week, but I figured maybe I would find some natural remedies to at least help a little because the itching was unbearable. Turns out among the tea tree and neem oils, bathing in apple cider vinegar, you could also soak the affected areas with a cayenne pepper bath. I guess the pepper literally burns the surface mites. 

Desperate as I was, I set up a bath with everything: threw in the oils, vinegar, and a fuck ton of cayenne pepper. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but I fully immersed myself in the water. I was soaking and scrubbing my legs for a few minutes when I felt a strange sensation. I paused for a moment, then yelped in pain and jumped straight out of the bathtub. My downstairs was fucking SEARING...on both ends.

I quickly drained the tub and tried to rinse out both my lady parts and butthole, but to no avail. Peeing helped a bit, but there is some definite bleeding in my backside and the burn is killing me.

A couple of days later I very grudgingly broke it off because I figured that's that - no sexual chemistry, and I didn't want to string him along.  But I really want this to not be the case because I rarely (obviously being 22 and only having just had my first kiss) meet guys whom I like quite like this.  Maybe it was just so new that I couldn't appreciate it and a second go-round would prove more lady-boner inducing?

TITLE: I(17F) am hoping to move out of my pregnant, abusive, mothers house and in with my boyfriend (18M) after I turn 18. He still lives at his parents house, what can I do to make them more likely to agree to this situation?
POST: As the title says I need to move out of my house. My current living situation is not healthy and most days more often than not I cry for at least an hour because of my mother and how she treats me. She is also pregnant. I made a post awhile ago about this and my current situation for those of you who read this and it sounds familiar. 

My boyfriends parents have briefly offered before but I don't know if they were serious or not... We plan to ask them at some point soon, they do not know that my current home life is as bad as it is and I'm contemplating telling them when we ask if it would be a possibility.

 As a bit of a background my boyfriends older brother got a girl pregnant his senior year in high school and she lived with them for a long time(they have since moved out) she was lazy, created messes and basically left her kid with them so she could go do whatever it's is that she does. I would be coming into their home at least looking for a job but hopefully already having one, with a license (she didn't have one, only recently got one) and car, a high school graduate (she dropped out), in an abusive home, in college, plus I cook and clean which she never did. I'm really hoping these things will swing them in my favor. Also I would only be living there for around a year or a bit longer but not by much. Please no relationship judgement, I know we are young but this is pretty much my only option and we love each other dearly. 

His parents are a bit strict and weary of having another grandchild. That would work against me. At this point we aren't supposed to be in a room alone, if this happened that would be common.... 
Also we've been together over a year.

TITLE: [19/m] About to meet girl [19/f] for the first time after months of online/text chat. Anyone have similar experience? Please share.
POST: Almost a year ago I met this girl on a online site and since then we have text almost every day and spoken on the phone a number of times. I don't know why we have never skyped, none of us have ever brought it up. We have however exchanged pics/videos so I'm 99.9999% she isn't some stranger from Ghana.

Anyway we've hit it off really well and I get on with her unlike anyone else I've ever spoken too. We come to eachother for advice and we have quite a good sense of eachothers personalities. Now recently she said she is going somewhere and with a bit more conversation this may end up being our first meeting as I've been looking to go somewhere and she suggested that I go with her as at least she'd roughly know someone. 

She is an incredibly nicest person and we have spoken about past relationships, she said she isn't one to judge and I've spoken/seen people she has been out with before and she herself described them as ""not exactly lookers"", so I'm not afraid of her seeing me and being like ""what kind of creature are you"" as I'm not exactly overweight or hard to look at. I am however still incredibly nervous that we may not get along, why I have no idea. 

I'm not looking for advice on what to do I am however hoping that some here have been in a similar situation and how it ended up?

TITLE: Cold applying for a marketing position in a small local company by attaching a proposal for their business website. Feasible idea?
POST: Hello /r/jobs, I graduated a few months ago and had no luck so far to get a job in marketing/sales. 

There's a small local company (perhaps 30 employees) but they are actually pretty successful in what they're doing (known worldwide). I checked their website and it's awful. Looks like a website from the early 2000's. So I guess they are not pretty good in (online-)marketing. 

I would like to do a cold application (not sure if they are looking for a marketing guy) but I had no luck with this kind of application in the past. That's why I thought I try something different. I have good skills in photoshop, indesign and illustrator. As a teenager I also built websites using HTML, so I thought I build a dummy website fitted to their company and attach some screenshots to my application.

What do you think? I this a feasible idea or will they be offended?

Thank you very much in advance.

TITLE: My boyfriend (34F) gave me an ultimatum, I realized it's a deal breaker for me(29F). He's still a good person and I'm lost on how to proceed with the breakup.
POST: We've been together three years. He has a degree (communications), tried to go back for another (more useful) one and got burnt out. He works a dead end job now, but is happy, which is important to me. But I'm also frustrated because I feel like I have more responsibilities in our relationship. I carry him on my insurance, pay for our car (which I do use more), make our house budget/cleaning chart and am trying to save up for a house for us.

For two years, he told me this job was temporary while he figured out which direction he wanted to go with his career. Last night he sat me down and told me he needed to give me an ultimatum (his words, ""I don't mean it to be one, but it is""). He knows his job isn't what I want him to be doing but he's okay with it. He appreciates that I've been trying to support him figuring it out, but he's going to stop that and just live in the moment....for now. He knows himself and when he figures it out, he'll be passionate and dive in. 

At the time, I was relieved to hear him tell me straight up.....but after a night of sleep and a day to digest everything he said, the full weight is sinking in. This is a deal breaker for me. I respect his reasons (personal happiness is really important) and wish him well (he's a good person), but I've never been in this spot before. All my past relationships ended with fireworks, drama, tears.... this feels very ""we both are in different places."" 

Our lease is up at the end of June. Do I say something now? Wait until a month out? All these feelings just hit me on my lunch break and I'm starting to panic! I know it will be a hard breakup in the sense that we both love one another and neither did anything wrong, but that just knots my stomach even more! I don't want to make him feel guilty.

POST: Sorry in advance for the wall of text this seems to be! I didn't' mean for it.
Earlier this week, my ex dumped me because she said she couldn't be a good student (we are both in university) and a good girlfriend. Before this all happened we couldn't really see each other very much but we still texted and tried out best.

I've always been there for her and optimistic that we would find the time when we could to make the most of it. I drove her home from a weekend staying in our hometown and we try to figure things out but it ends up we break up and I'm heartbroken

I still drive her home and do my best but she sends me a long message saying that she can't bare to see pictures of me with friends or in a relationship so she deletes me. I'm confused about the whole situation but somehow talk myself into that it's for the best. 

The next day when I come home from school I see a bag on the doorstep. When I look inside its all the things I gave her through the time together. I was crushed. I felt betrayed, lonely, and couldn't understand what I did to deserve this. I quickly glance at her roommate's Facebook and see that they went out downtown and I think the worse. Of all the years I've known her, I've never seen her act like this.

Now that it has been some time I am doing better. I try not to look too much into what she is doing but I feel wrong and I have urges to at least Facebook her or say hey at school. I was wondering if anyone else could relate or provide some guidance.

POST: I'm a senior in college right now and my boyfriend and I had been dating for about a year when he ended it very abruptly about 2 months ago. With that it ended pretty explosively. The initial breakup was - as normal - upsetting but fine. Within days though he was pestering me via text and through mutual friends, constantly trying to get me to talk to him. Basically, when I went back to his place to get my stuff back, it ended in an extremely heated argument with lots of yelling on his end.

Fastforward 2 months and we've just gotten back from our separate spring breaks. I come home to a text from him saying that breaking up with me was the biggest mistake of his life and that he would like an opportunity to talk and a chance to prove his worth to me. We ended up talking for a long time during which we talked about what had happened during our relationship and he explained to me that he broke up with me because he was intimidated by the fact that I had a job so long before him and that there were some pretty bad problems going on at home that he felt he couldn't talk to me about.

We've been texting a little over the past few days since I said we could try being friends. Tonight though, I received a long text from him saying basically he would like to date me again because he has realized that I am ""the one"" and he wants a second chance.

So confused here, I have no idea what to do and I am feeling incredibly torn. Any advice would be much appreciated.

TITLE: Is it really possible to meet the right person at the wrong time?
POST: This past October I (19F) met a really great guy (20M) through tinder. We went on a few dates here and there and got along really well.

However, we did run into some problems when it came to hanging out. If I had some free time, he would be working or in school (does both full time). And if he had free time I'd be in school or not home at the time (plus, I don't have my license yet so transportation was a factor too). This made it really difficult for us to hang out and see each other more. 

Today, we started talking on snapchat and he told me he doesn't think this can work anymore. I was crushed because I was really starting to like him and he even told me he had feelings for me as well. He said he just wants to work on himself for a while. I asked him if it's possible if things do work out in the future will he reconsider trying again. He didn't give me a straight answer saying it just depends on when it happens. 

So my question for you /r/relationships is it possible to meet the right person at the wrong time? And if yes, can things work out in the end? I'm really hurt right now and don't know how to feel because this has never happened to me before.

TITLE: Me [34M] with my separated wife [33F] 14 years, why do i feel nothing?
POST: Quick run down of the relationship:

Whirlwind romance and 6 months later Married young (20 and 19 respectively), together for 14 years, 2 kids over the course of it. In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.

For a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to ""evaluate her feelings"", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of ""us"", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.

After a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical/mental affection (often not both at the same time).

Is this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?
Should i be open about my feelings and experiences (we made a clause on breakup, she didnt want to know anything i did with other people while we were separated, and told me to lie if i had done anything) or would that just end everything, and if it did is that for the best?

If someone could just live my life for me for a bit and give it back in a few months that would be grand :D

POST: Over this weekend I was able to meet a remarkable girl. Pretty much from the get go it was obvious that at least I was interested (I drunkenly gave her a flower at a cocktail party to start off our first conversation), but she also ended up hanging out with me the next night as well at my house, albeit with her friend. She knows I have a crush on her. I know she is interested in me at the least as a friend, but I am not fully confident if she is interested as anything more (we've only met a couple days, I'm about 60-70% sure she's interested in me beyond friendship - I thought I heard her asking her friend if it was okay to sleep over at my place but I'm not sure).

I don't have a problem with LDRs provided they are serious but to be honest, I have my own life and school to focus on now anyway. I don't think I want a relationship as of the current moment. I'm more interested in down the road - this is the first girl that I met that is astoundingly pretty, captivating, and is part of my exact same culture (families are pretty much the exact same which I value a lot). Practically speaking, it's perfect material for a serious relationship save for the fact that she lives far away. Which pretty much renders the whole thing impractical as of the moment.

I want to continue talking to her but I'm not sure where or how to gear the relationship. I'd like to get to know her better but also be in a place in the future where she knows I'm (likely) seriously interested and I can figure out if she is seriously interested in a relationship.

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell while driving
POST: I'll start from this morning. It was a normal day for me. I woke up at around 7:30 as I usually do so I could wake up and get to work on time. I did so, worked my 8 hours, clocked in, clocked out. My coworkers wanted to go out to get something to eat, but I wasn't feeling social today, so I passed and walked to my car.

However, I was feeling rather hungry. I'm currently on a diet, but I've been on it for a rather long time (around 6 months) so I had forgotten what the taste of a deliciously disgusting Taco Bell taco tasted like. Once I started thinking about it, I couldn't stop so I set my course to the nearest Taco Bell about 15 minutes away.

After driving for a bit I finally reached my destination. I pulled up to the drive-thru, placed my order for 2 tacos, a crunchwrap and a large Mountain Dew. I pulled up to the next window, paid for my order, and sat the bag of food on the passenger seat next to me. I checked my phone to see what time it was, and determined that I had enough time to eat in a parking space and be home in time for my family. 

Let's just say I fucking ravaged those first 2 tacos. I scarfed them down like I've never seen what a scrap of food looked like before. As I'm about to move onto my crunchwrap, I get a phonecall from my wife asking where I am.

""You're at Taco Bell?! You said you'd drive Caitlyn (our daughter) to soccer practice!""

Shit. I hung up the phone and stepped on the gas with one hand on the wheel and another on my crunchwrap. I was doing 70 on the highway trying to rush back to get my daughter there on time. 

But that crunchwrap was way to delicious. I was paying too much attention to the deliciousness, the amazingness, the...

I felt a thud. My windshield cracked. I pulled over and stepped out of my car to what was the remains of a now dead deer and a busted windshield along with other damages to my car. Caitlyn was late to practice.

I guess it was because of a lot of stuff that's been building up throughout our relationship. It is long distance because I'm away at college so I definitely understand why things went sour. For clarification, I broke up with her. She was fairly controlling throughout our relationship and was also extremely clingy. I never really got any appreciation for the stuff I did for her and she is also an extremely jealous person. I'm the only person that she has to rely on when she needs someone and she expects me to be at her side at the drop of a hat. We had different views on a lot of things, including religion, marriage, and children, but we were extremely serious and considering engagement in the future. Fiscally, she wasn't really appropriate for me because she is a rather large spender while I prefer to save our money. Unfortunately, I would give in on these whims and now I don't really have much to show for working throughout my high school career. Although things haven't been that good for us when we are away from one another, they are typically really good when we are together. After breaking up with her, she told me that she was going to change everything that I dislike about her because she had figured all of this out already and was wanting to fix it before anything bad happened. I told her that it was a little too late because these problems have come up before and they were never fixed, but she insisted that she would keep trying she also said that she hopes that we can get back together some time in the future.

Our relationship is loving and happy, and due to the fact that we live approximately 45 minutes away from each other (both living with our parents [embarrassing, but resources we're lucky to have]) have to restrict our visits to about 2 days a week. 

We did the 2 days a week for a year and a half, then we got an apartment together for 6 months. When we lived together life was wonderful, and I couldn't ask for better. Due to various financial difficulties compounded by extreme family crises, we both moved back to our parents' homes until the crises were dealt with and we had enough saved up to move out again. The time to move out of my parents' house is coming up,  I'm unsure if when I move back out it should be with him.

It has always been extremely important to me that I live by myself for at least a year, at some (relatively early) point in my adult life. My mom drilled in to me that you must learn to be alone in order to function well within relationships, and I think at this point I would feel like I had missed out on something major if I didn't experience living on my own soon. 

I've talked about this with my boyfriend and he understands/encourages me to do what I need to do, but I don't want to move without him. So much of my relationship with him has been spent with strict limits on time that when the opportunity arises to live with him again I know I won't want to say ""No"". Plus, it just seems like a huge economic waste for us both to be paying for an apartment, Internet, etc. etc., when we could just be splitting the bill (our low incomes plays a role in my trepidation as well), when he moves to the same city I'm moving to.

POST: I've been dating Boyfriend for about 8 months, and this isn't a huge problem or a deal breaker. I love him a lot and we have plans on marrying when I'm done with university. Unfortunately, this has been a problem for a long while now, and it's really been getting troublesome these past couple days.

See, the more time goes on, the more sex I want to have with him. I see sex as one of the few ways that I feel close to him. For him, though, sex is just an extra thing to do with the person he loves. Which is fine, except that there are days when he's just too tired to do things. And while I respect that, those also happen to be the days where I see him the least, which makes me want to feel close to him even more. It hurts to be turned down, and it hurts him to hurt me, and it hurts me to hurt him, so on and so forth. While its only been this difficult these past couple of days, we both agree that this is kind of a problem that should be resolved sooner rather than be held off.

My position is to change, and that it's my own problem that I have to deal with. He doesn't think I should, though, and that there's some middle ground that we can reach that works. I'm really not sure what to do. Masturbation doesn't really work, and forcing him to put out is not an option.
TL;DR: ","I crave sex when my boyfriend can't put out, and we both feel bad about it. Not sure whether I should change how I am, or if there's a middle ground."

TITLE: My bf [23] doesn't speak of his childhood, but I[f22] know he's traumatized.
POST: We were friends for 10 years, before we got together. He than told me once about his terrible childhood. (He told only 3 of his friends his story)

Now we're a couple for quite a few months and well, sometimes there's stuff I know that reminds him of his childhood, but it's like he's forgotten that he had told me. So he keeps pretending that nothing happened.

Some examples
Lately we were watching an old TVshow, that every child watched when we're young, like Sesamestreet, and he couldn't remember a thing. (Which I think is because he forced himself to forget everything.)
He likes christmas, but only the food, not the stuff with Santa, and he hates to get presents. (Which is the thing childs like the most about christmas.)
And stuff like watching TVshows about raising children. We talk about how we're going to raise ours in the future and that we won't will be as horrible as the parents on TV. (But striking, the things he thinks are important are always the things his parents should have done, to save him from the traumatizing stuff.)

I know he likes to put his problems far away. But on the other hand, I'm his girlfriend now and we're pretty serious, isn't it good to speak about it maybe just once, so he knows I know his secret/won't tell, and most of all, I'm always there for him?

What do you think?

POST: Hey everyone, my girlfriend doesn't go out a lot but when she does start drinking she has a hard time stopping and goes too far and gets black out drunk. She has promised me on multiple occasions that she wasn't going to over do it with the drinking but still drank way too much. As her boyfriend, I feel uncomfortable when she is that intoxicated around other guys because she is vulnerable and her friends have proven in the past that they don't look out for her if she gets into a bad situation.

TITLE: Me (28F) with my (32F) sister. She has been struggling to get pregnant for well over a year. My husband and I started trying and I'm pregnant within the month. How can I approach this with sensitivity without overthinking everything?
POST: Hi reddit! I've created this new account for anonymity. 

My sister and I have a good relationship despite living half way around the world from one another. I recently found out I was pregnant and figured I shouldn't overthink it and just tell her as I would have told her in the past (before knowing about her visits with fertility doctors etc). She responded very sweetly and is texting me asking several excited questions and there doesn't seem to be any weirdness at all. She seems genuinely thrilled that I'm going to be a mum!

However, I'm still a little worried and overthinking things in my head. I am worried that deep down she is sad and how I should best respect her feelings without making it an issue. The fertility issues she is having would have stayed between her and her husband had it not been for an awkward visit with my mother. My mum visited her (my parents also live in a different country.) and she had to tell my mum because there were so many secret appointments etc. My mum is not the most tactful person and rather than understand it was a private issue just got incredibly excited they were trying, to the point that when she left their house she left a note and candles in their bedroom wishing them luck. Cringe. So my sister and I have been bonding over how cheesy our mum is being.

I'm looking for advice on how to go forward. Should I just pretend that everything is normal and follow her cues? Should I be more sensitive about the subject because of what she is going through?

I can't help but feel guilty. I wasn't going to share with her how long we were trying but when she asked I couldn't lie to her. I feel awful that I got to tell the family happy news before she could. I feel guilty as a little sister to be pregnant before my big sister who deserves it so much. I started trying because it's the right time in my life but I was prepared for it to take much longer! I can't help but wish I had waited a little longer until she could have her moment.

TITLE: A friend from my old high school asked me to prom, but I really would rather not go.
POST: I'm a freshman in college and a friend of mine texted me last week and asked if I would be her back up date to her senior prom. I explained that I would be getting my wisdom teeth out at the end of May, and I very well may not be able to go so I can't promise anything, so I would have to be her backup.

However, a guy in her grade asked her and she really didn't want to go with him, so she made up this story about how she was trying to work something out with a guy from the next town over, but I was her back up in case it didn't 

She asked me if I would be cool going with her because if she went with someone else from her grade it would look bad. What should I say to her? I actually might be getting my wisdom teeth out during that time so I don't know. I don't want to leave her hanging but I've been to six proms and I think I've had my fill.

TITLE: TIFU by water skiing and tubing all weekend
POST: I spent the whole weekend at my buddy's lake house with a few friends, most of which was out on the boat. Now, this was my first time at a lake house and doing all these cool lake house things. I was dying to wakeboard/water ski since I am big into skateboarding and longboarding. I assumed that I'd pick it up pretty quickly considering my experience in other balance related activities. And what do you know, I did pretty well. We took turns on the skis and also battled it out on tubes as well. 
However the fuck up comes in this entire week because I did *not* take into account the muscle strength it takes to hold on for your fucking life when being dragged behind a boat like that. And we were out there all damn day. So I've barely had the muscle strength in my forearms to grip just about anything. Opening the fridge? Nope, grabbing my backpack? Fucking nope. Anything requiring flexing my fingers? Absolutely not. It's been almost a week and it's finally getting to the point where I can function normally again.

TITLE: friend zone: not sure if the girl i like has attraction to me
POST: His, 

I have known that girl for over 3 years and it's only a year ago that I understood that I am very attracted to her, more than just a friend. In the meantime she has gotten a boyfriend and i really don't know how to act now. 

What worsens things is that I am pretty shy and nerdy, and since more reactive than initiative. She is the type of girl though who expects initiative in a relationship. 

I told her about my feelings and we have never touched this theme since. The furtherst we've gone physically is holding each other's hands and hugging but I am not sure if it's more a courtesy of friendship. She did mention that she is not that much satisfied with her current relationship, though she tries avoiding exclusive hang-outs with me inviting others because ""it's more fun"".

I am not sure what would be the best way to go now. Most of all I want to  know if she has some deeper feelings to me. The reason is that I would hate ruining our friendship by pushing too far. But how could I find it out, revealing it in a conversation is not an option since it would be too selfish and I guess she is equally unsure about my intentions. And I think that staying by friends and seeing what happens   I will just be locked in the friend zone.

We started dating at the beginning of this year, so we've been together 4-5 months give or take. I realize it's fresh and all, and maybe I just need to give it time, but we haven't had a single argument, fight, or disagreement. I mean, it's not that I *want* one, it's just that I find it odd.

Is it normal? I know everyone says arguing in relationships is completely normal, some people say it's abnormal to *not* fight, but we just haven't. We're both pretty mature and rational, we're both kinda loners and don't do much besides working and talking to each other, and we have quite a lot in common, so I guess there really isn't any reason for us *to* fight but I just feel like it's kinda weird.

TITLE: TIP my friend by grounding him
POST: The Background:
You read it right, I didn't get him grounded, I actually grounded him. This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.
Events Leading to the Prank:
Now, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.
The Setup:
I got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.
The Execution:
You can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo

TITLE: Me [24F] with my BF [27M] 3 months, sometimes guys hit on me in front of my BF and insult him in the process. How to react in the moment and afterwards?
POST: Hi Reddit,

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I think I saw a thread with a similar question but I can't seem to find it now so any advice is appreciated.

I started seeing my BF about 3 months ago and he is really incredible. He's witty and kind and I find him incredibly, incredibly handsome and dashing. I think I'm a fairly average looking woman and get hit on from time to time, but I've noticed that it has gotten more aggressive or nasty with my boyfriend around? When a guy hits on me, I'll usually just say thank you but I'm not interested or I have a boyfriend. If my boyfriend is there with me, some guys will give him a full once over and say something along the lines of ""This guy?"" or ""You're outta his league"" or ""I could show you a better time"". Something completely disrespectful to my bf. I don't know where it's coming and he doesn't usually react. I'm not the most confident person so I'll usually just say that was rude or ignore it, but I want to know how I could react or what I could do to reassure my bf in those times. I know if it were me, I'd probably be a bit self conscious or upset but he hasn't said anything. I've tried to bring it up but he brushes it off like it isn't a big deal and maybe it isn't. I don't want to make it seem like a big deal if he's actually not upset, but I also want to make sure he's feeling good about us after this.

Sorry for the rambling! So people of reddit, I'm just wondering how you would like your SO to respond to those guys or what you'd like him/her to do afterwards or say to make you feel secure in the relationship.

Thanks!

TITLE: I [21 F] feel like I deserved to get hit by my dad.
POST: First off, I'm on mobile so sorry for any errors.

 I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 and a half years and things are going great between us. We're both seniors in college and we're just honestly so excited to see what life has in store for the both of us. But I'll just admit this here: I've been sneaking him in so we can spend alone time with each other. My parents didn't know any of this was happening until my dad came home super early from work Friday and caught us. I was in the shower while my boyfriend was in my room, which is downstairs. I opened the window and made him hop my fence before my dad could see him. Needless to say, my dad and my mom have been very disappointed in me (for good reason) but my dad built up his anger against me and let it all go today. When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it. My excuse  (albeit a bad one I admit) was that I was helping my aunt and the rest of my family clean up their apartment's party room after the baby shower and I couldn't feel my phone vibrate. When we got home, he made faces at me (like he always does when he's angry at someone) he then asked me who came over Friday. I told him that it was a guy. He asked more questions like how long has this been going on, and why did he leave without seeing him. I answered him like ""a while now"" and ""because I was scared about what you would say"". I was crying a little at this point because I was just so scared of him and thats when he lunged at me with his fist. Thankfully my mom came just in time and I told her what happened.

I understand I did something wrong and I really should have told my dad I was dating someone. Because of all these lies and shit I said and done I feel like I really deserved to get punched. I'm also really scared now and I just don't know what to do from here.

TITLE: [NSV] Finally broke the compulsive eating cycle
POST: I've been struggling for some time with compulsive overeating habits. I've been sticking to a reasonable 1,700 calorie diet over the last 5 weeks with the aim of making a lifestyle change and hoping that, as a result, my weight would drop too. This morning I finally stepped on the scale and saw I was worthy of my first flair (after 5 weeks) yay!

But then I had a crappy day at work, ate too much for lunch and on the way home all I could think about was a giant, comforting meal of  pizza, or french fries, or mac and cheese, or Chinese food, or anything fatty and greasy. When I got home, my roommate even asked if I wanted to order dinner later and I initially said yes. Then I thought long and hard about what I really wanted. I wanted something that made me feel cozy and comforted, that was warm and rich. So I changed into my favorite pjs, fired up the kettle, made myself a giant mug filled with chicken broth, and curled up in bed. As I sipped the broth, my bad mood passed, I felt satisfied, and no longer wanted take out or crappy food. I made myself a giant salad for dinner instead.

POST: I'm not 100% sure if I have what it takes to make this huge change, but I feel like being a Veternarian is something I really want to do in life.  
     A bit of background. I'm currently 24, graduated with a finance degree 3 years ago. I'm currently a financial rep focusing on selling insurance.  Even though I don't hate my job I feel like it doesn't fit my personality.  But I stuck with it for a while because I don't like to quit easily. The idea of becoming a vet happened when a chinchilla of mine 
passed because I didn't take it to the vet in time, and I really love 
animals. People tell me I'm a warm person and great with kids and 
animals. I feel like this is something I came up with myself and not what other want me to be.
     So back to reality, I did a tiny bit of research on this. The closest grad school that has this program is Cornell university (I'm located in NY) I'd probably need to do an undergrad in science or medical field.  I'm a little unsure of 8 more years of school, but I guess if there's no other choice.  Another concern is money, I only have about 10k in bank, I cannot touch my retirement and life insurance money. I'm not sure if I can qualify for any federal grant. I may also need to move back with my parents. One idea I have is to just brokage product with high residuals while I wait to get into a school. I'll also appraciate any insight and experiences from a vet or a person going back to school.

POST: I need to get this off my chest and get some advice from the community.

My gf and I have been doing long distance for about 5 months and dating for 1 year. We will be living in the same city again come June hence why we decided to give a LDR a try. 

The time we spend together has been great and we usually see each other for long weekends every couple of weeks. 

A few months ago I found out that my gf cheated on me (she kissed another guy in a club). I decided to give her a last chance but if I'm entirely honest, since it happened I have not taken the relationship as seriously as I used to. 

This weekend, I went down to see her (hadn't seen her in 3 weeks). I got her flowers, chocolates and a card for valentine's day. She spent most of the day with her friends and I didn't even get a card in return. In the evening I cooked her a nice dinner, then we had a bit of a fall out and she spent the rest of the evening hanging out with friends. 

Needless to say, this morning I was pretty fed up and have initiated a 2 week ""trial break-up"". She was really upset. We won't be talking for 2 weeks and will then meet up to decide whether to end it or continue.

Am I being perfectly reasonable here or am I just being overly sensitive? Obviously I love her to bits and the text above is only really showing her in bad light - but these are the things I'm picking up on. Our sex life isn't great either. She has a slight cold and so there was no love making this weekend (even after not seeing each other for 3 weeks).

I didn't want to go to urgent care because I was sure they'd send me home saying I just had super bad gas or something else embarrassing.  Thankfully my boyfriend talked me into it, and upon finding that Urgent care wasn't open yet we went to the ER and got there within an hour after my pains started.  After getting there they started to calm down, so now I was even more sure that it was somethign dumb and I was just going to be embarrassed.

After getting bloodwork done and a cat scan, the doctor comes in and informs me that I have appendicitis and need my appendix removed.  I was in surgery by 12:30 and have been on pain killers since yesterday and will be released either tonight or tomorrow.

So, if it wasn't for my boyfriend being more stubborn than me I could have had my appendix rupture and died, since we only have one car and he brought me to the hospital 20 minutes before he would have had to leave for work.

POST: Okay....so me and this girl, we've been dating for two months now. She's a virgin, and I'm a virgin. Hell, she's so innocent, it's not even funny.

But, we've recently started to get a lot more physical. From about the second week, we've been sleeping together. As in, we would cuddle and then sleep in the same bed. We might make out a little bit, but it was mostly the cuddling and the sleeping.

Then, I started with the dry-humping, and she reciprocated, and clothes started coming off. Only above the waist, however. I quickly learned how to properly take off a bra.

And then, just within this last week, we moved to third base. It started with me rubbing outside of the shorts she wore to bed, and then I asked if she minded me moving inside the shorts, and she said no, so I did. And she's given me a handjob before too. Mostly, though, I feel like it's been me.

And I want it, in the moment. And she wants it--she never hasn't wanted it. But, afterwards, I always feel like shit. I wouldn't say I regret it, but I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for initiating it, and for almost pushing the boundaries.

I guess, what I'm asking here more than anything, is that should this be happening? Is this one of those things that should just *feel* right from the moment you're doing it? Like, when you're doing it and when you're not? As bad as this sounds, could it be a sign that she's not really ""the one"" and that, knowing that, I should break up with her?

Basically, this summer we took a class at my school (cheaper for him since his school is out of state) and he stayed at my house (because gas). Class lasts a month. When the class ends, he goes back to school and I pretty much haven't heard from him since. 

Its been a month, and I've tried texting him and calling him but he ignores me. He called once to say he was sorry and make excuses (he's ""busy"") and he referenced things I told him in my text messages, so obviously he's reading them, but just not bothering to respond.

I just don't understand what's going on with him. I go from talking to him every day to being completely cut off. I can't just talk to him about it because he'll just ignore me. I don't know if its because he's got a gf now so he doesn't need meanymore, or if we're just doing the whole ""growing apart"" thing way more rapidly than I expected. 

I really just want to get some perspective on this, because its really upsetting me. Also, last school year he didn't have a girlfriend and we talked pretty much every day. So I'm just assuming this has something to do with her.

POST: I understand that she needs space to grieve, and that she needs to come to grips with what happened, after the abortion, i was her only shoulder to cry on,of course her parents were there to support and talk to, but she didn't want to due to fear, shame and embarrassment. 

So after the abortion we thought it would be a breeze, that wasn't the case, it happened around 3/4 months ago and our relationship hasn't been the same, for around 3 months after it was constant battling at eachother and tears of what happened but i'd always support her.

My mum and a close friend have told me to not text her at all, wait for her to come to, open the door, then come in and pick everything up again. But i had to text her and just let her know im waiting for her and would never abandon her, any hour of the day i would be here. The reason im worrying is because she has one therapy session a week, and she doesn't talk to her mum about it as much as she should, she's even admitted shes depressed and i could see it.

Her exact reply to my text was ""That definitely put a smile on my face! So nice to hear that fro you, you mean everything to me still and just for you to understand that honestly makes me the happiest person alive""

The problem is, i don't want her bottling everything up and not speaking to anyone, i hate knowing she could be sat upset, feeling alone, and of course i don't want,after all this space, her to think i was never here from her, feelings to go,and to get a wrong impression of me.

What shall i do?
Should i call or text her at all?

TITLE: So I just found out my girlfriend is unhappy in our relationship [4-1/2 yrs, 24/m 23/f]
POST: I really hope you guys can help me on this one.

So I'm very technology savvy. I have worked in computer repair and the IT field for the last 7 years.

I met my girlfriend her freshmen year of college (I was a sophomore transfer) and we've been dating each other our entire college career. She's graduating this year (I graduated last year and came back for an MS). I worked on her computer about a month ago because it was running slow, freezing, etc. so I looked at it over a night. While I had her computer, my curiosity got the best of me.

I found myself in a junk folder that had a lot of misc stuff in it, under which I found a pro-con list that turned out to be about myself; the things she liked (pros) and the things she didn't like (cons). I saw it and it kind of shook me up. I didn't sleep well that night, as I drempt she broke up with me. The next morning I told her about the dream. She consoled me and said she wasn't breaking up with me anytime soon.

Moving on, I found she had created an account on a dating advice forum, and I found all of her posts. The first ones were from back when she was in high school. Later on she posted about us. The most recent one was a day before our four year anniversary. It was asking for advice on how to break up with me because she is no longer happy in the relationship. In it she states that some of her friends and family have been telling her to break up with me for well over a year. We're involved in a lot of the same things, so it would be awkward for both of us to break up.

It's now 8 months later. I have never seen any signs from her personally that she is displeased with our relationship. I love her so much, but now that I've seen this, I feel she just puts up a front to make me happy and not make life a living hell while we still spend time together.
TL;DR: ","I found out my girlfriend isn't happy in our relationship anymore and I don't know whether to talk to her and let her know that I now know she isn't happy, or just let things continue until she decides to end things."

TITLE: X-post from r/relationships: [Throwaway] My housemate has been evicted, but seems to be refusing to collect his stuff. What now? (United Kingdom)
POST: Am located in the UK. 

Two weeks ago, my housemate was evicted after a spate of horrible behaviour and 'forgetting' to pay his rent. The landlord is taking him to court over the late rent payments (which amount to several thousand pounds), which he didn't think he'd have to pay if he moved out right away.

He has left everything apart from his laptop. That includes bedding, clothes and loads of personal items that I'm sure are worth a lot of money. He doesn't seem to understand that he needs to come and get it, saying that he'll ""come when he wants"". As far as I know, he hasn't even contacted any housing agencies to try and get a new place.

I don't want to be stuck with his stuff until he finds a new place; I have new tenants moving in! I've contacted the city council but they just said to wait and see if he came to get it, which wasn't really helpful.

Does Reddit have any advice at all? Anything would help!

POST: So being a kid about to leave for college in a week, I was just thinking of all the ridiculous things that have gone on with my family and friends. One of the main things that still sticks in my mind is the one time that my dad took the entire family on vacation up to a lake in Central PA. On the last night, my dad had gotten properly drunk with some of the locals. On his way back he insisted that we go ""quilling"". 
For those not familiar with this sport, it involves a car, a bunch of drunk friends, some towels, and a shit load of porcupines. Basically, my dad convinced my mom to drive around backroads at about 230 in the morning trying to find porcupines. When we saw some on the road, my friend and i would jump out, chase them down and whip them with towels to see how many of their quills we could get. (their quills grow back and its painless for them, bring on PETA). All in all we came back with 200 some quills and a bunch of good memories.

TITLE: I[22M] Completely hung up on friend[25F]
POST: Hey Reddit!

So, for some back story I've been going out with this girl for sometime. We met about a year ago, went out a few times, i'd say we hit it off and I definitely liked her. We decided not to ""date"" for a few different reason but did the friends with benefits thing for a few months. She ended up trying to see someone else a few months ago and contact pretty much stopped between us. We would talk here and there, all started by me, but that was it for the most part.

Around mid January we started to casually do things again. Turns out what she was doing with this other guy didn't work out and I was happy because I had my friend back. We have since gone out a few times and some of the nights we even ended up hooking up again. Coming to last weekend, we went out and at the end of the night it was awkward. I tried to initiate a kiss with her and she didn't want much to do with it. The next day we talked for a while through text, and decided that were good friends and doing things probably isn't going to end up well, which i agree with.

My problem though is that I am so hung up on her. I definitely have more feelings for her than she realizes and i'm in a strange spot and have no idea what to do. She is an extremely important person to me, and I don't want her out of my life but I am killing myself with these thoughts and feelings that I keep having. I know i have to ""man up"" and get over it, but how am I supposed to do it when we are good friends, and I don't want to stop talking or hanging out with her in that capacity?

TITLE: Feeling really empty for the past little while.
POST: Hey guys,

I'm an 18 year old high school student who's in their final year. About 2 months ago I was accepted to my dream school, and as such I'll be going off their in August. I'm extremely happy about it, it's one of the best schools in my country, and the place itself is beautiful. Needless to say, this relatively early university acceptance was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. 

But for whatever reason, I can't find it in myself to be happy. Most kids my age would be ecstatic and hopeful for the future. And while I am happy that I'll be moving out on my own, I can't help but feel incredible emptiness. Every night I just waste away the day browsing internet forums or listening to music. My usual hobby of videogames can't grip me like it used to; any time I try a new game I lose interest after a few hours, maybe a few days if I'm lucky. The only thing that can hold my attention for more than a few days is reading books, but even with that, I have to take a break every half hour or else I zone out.

Do you guys have any advice for me? I have nothing to be sad about, my life is great as it is, but at the same time I don't feel happy about anything. I usually feel comfortable with my friends, but we've been talking less and less recently, due to conflicting schedules at school.

A particular situation is nagging at me though. Last night she went to a movie in the park with her neighbor and his friend. I met them on my journey out there and thought they were weird but harmless.

She tells me today that they all got pretty drunk and one of the guys was hitting on her, the neighbor kept trying to put his arm around her, and one of their friends tried to make a move to kiss her at the end of the night. She said that she declined all of these advances and I don't have any reason to doubt her, but what bothers me the most is that the she let the guy who tried to kiss her sleep on her couch.

She says she's only interested in me and that she found those guys, desperate and creepy, but it bothers me that she didn't see it to begin with and that she didn't just flat out kick them out of her apartment. Is she just overly flirty/nice. Is this a red flag?

I already have trust issues and the LDR thing is compounding them. I'd love to have an honest discussion about it, but don't want to seem controlling or overly jealous.

POST: I'm sure these types of posts crop of from time to time, so I apologize if you've seen this all before.

I'm looking for a little advice.  To begin, I'll give you some background information.  I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force.  While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations.  I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have.  I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology.  I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010.  I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010.  I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers.  I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money.  I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking.  I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS?  A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

POST: When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again. So, what is my problem? Is there anything I can do to regain my sharpness and should I start cutting out my excessive hours of video games?

POST: Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm going to be starting a new job soon at 130k a year, with a rather special circumstance. As part of the terms of me being hired, I need to set up a S Corp, and essentially be business to business in terms of the relationship with the company.

I know it sounds super sketchy for a company to require me to do that, but it makes sense in context. I am 20 years old, and HR would never green light 130k for a 20 year old dude, so this is the solution that was proposed.

I understand that I take on more taxes because of me being self employed (the other half of the taxes normally paid by the employer), but I am lost as to how to count anything. I should be paying myself a salary, and then paying the rest through dividends correct? Are there any sort of step by step guides on how to do this correctly?

Also, is there a way (short of sitting down with a CPA) to calculate my take home pay when counting dividends and federal/state/local taxes? I looked online at tax calculators, and they either seem too simple, or vary wildly. Some say that I would owe 10k total per year (seems too low) and some say that I would owe 50k total per year (seems wayyy to high).

Furthermore (sorry for the wall of text), I'd like to setup some sort of retirement account (or accounts), but since I will be self employed I'm not sure what avenue to take.

I have contacted a CPA in the area to setup an appointment to get incorporated, but was looking for some advice from more voices on the questions above. Thanks!

I was thoroughly surprised since he is a little jealous sometimes when it comes to other men, but I guess he could just call it ""hot"" if he really isn't taking me seriously.

Here is where things get a little complicated. I do believe I am bi-sexual, but never got the chance to act on it. Once when I was in high school me and one of my closest friends got drunkenly dared to kiss each other, and we did. What would she think if I came out as bi? And my best friend is gay, we never did anything, but would this complicate the relationship? I'm pretty scared to tell people- should I?

Also, some parts of my family aren't that accepting of non-heterosexual relationships, so if I came out, should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

Our 2 year anniversary was July 20th and I got him a cologne, a little bag of the candies he likes, and a new CD, along with a few more personal items. He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.

It sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me. This has happened at least 3 times already. Honestly I've lost excitement in going because I feel like it's never going to happen.

I can't bring it up to him because whenever I do he gets really upset and apologizes a lot, which I appreciate, but I just would rather him say that he can't take me (if that's the case) rather than continue to drag this out.

I feel bad for being upset, because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck. But it doesn't change the fact that he's been promising and not coming through, which is upsetting.

A few years later, and I fell off. I turn 24 next week, and I was recently juuuuust over 300 pounds. I live almost exactly 100 miles north of New York City. Last semester IU started commuting to the city for work and school. I still live up north, because I have another job up there. Train tickets got expensive, so I saved money by biking instead of taking the subway.

I only just started eating healthier a couple weeks ago, but I'm down about 10-15 pounds right now. Just hit 286, and I'm very happy. I know it isn't really progress, but it's nice to know that it's all improvement from here. I've done it before, and I can do it again. I know I won't let myself fall off.

Anyway, it has been getting easier, and I think now that it's warm I'll take up some weekend leisure rides. :)

I knew absolutely nothing about the series other than the brief introduction I had to it while playing the Interplay LOTR adventure game on PC in the mid-90's for half an hour once.

So for the first few discs I found it a little monotonous. Lots of awkward singing by the narrator, lots of painfully long descriptions of the Shire and lots of genealogy for minor characters, which I found odd. But I assumed it'd pick up since I had 14 discs left to go.

I'm currently on disc 9 (right as they're getting to Rivendell) but I absolutely cannot get interested in it, though not for lack of trying. Each commute it gets more difficult for me to keep listening rather than just throw on music or the news. Every time I get to a new disc I feel like I just finished several hours of homework and I have to bargain with myself to start the next one. 

It's not that I don't like it. I like Tolkien's style, the characters are ridiculously well-developed and I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was in the 1950's...I just can't figure out what's so interesting and exciting about it to so many people, and I certainly can't imagine spending 50+ more hours finishing out the entire trilogy. 

Can someone change my mind before I bail and take it back to the library on Tuesday? 

If it matters in your analysis, my normal taste is Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and non-fiction about science, politics and religion. My favorite book is Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett.

TITLE: Me [22F] with my Boyfriend [22M] 4 years, he wants to move in together and I'm not ready.
POST: So like the title says, we've been together 4 years, since we were 18 and all through our college years. Now that we've both graduated and are landing steady jobs we are looking to move out. He thinks it would make the most sense to move in together and has also mentioned getting engaged but not getting married for a while. I don't want to get engaged or married until my late 20s (that's always been my plan). I also side with my traditional mom and grandma who do not think moving in together is okay until we are at least planning a wedding. 

I can totally see myself marrying him if we are still together in several years. But I can also see things coming between us. I'm dead set on living in another country, and I might actually have to spend six months in another country within the next couple of years. He has always mentioned that he wants to stay in the town we live in now. I am also very chronically sick (nothing terminal, but sometimes debilitating) and he doesn't handle that very well when I'm going through a flare. 

I definitely love him with my whole heart and everyone thinks we're perfect together, but I'm still hesitant. How do I tell him I don't want to move in together and get engaged yet without hurting his feelings and making him think I don't love him?

TITLE: I [M/18] think my stepmother [F/44] is overstepping her boundaries
POST: For the past couple of years my father [M/52] has been married to my stepmother [F/44] and I [M/18] think she is overstepping boundaries and is taking advantage of my father in many situations.

Now, first of all, she isn't some horrible step mother, but she isn't great either. She doesn't have any kids of her own so she tries to punish me as if I was her kid, which my father allows. This would honestly not be a big deal, if she seemed sane...

She nitpicks at everything I do one week, and then loves me the next. The littlest thing can trigger her, such as what happened tonight.

I ran out of batteries in my remote, so I replaced them with the batteries in my dad's remote, which were in his bedroom. I do this a lot, and then hide the used batteries somewhere obvious so he puts them in and then the remote still doesn't work.

Nothing happened for a while, so I assumed they just replaced the batteries, so I fell asleep. I was awakened to screaming and yelling and slamming of the opening of my door. My stepmother was yelling about how 'going into their room was an invasion of privacy'... I would understand that if the door was locked... Or closed... Or not wide open... Or if I was never allowed to go in there before... But, no. It had never been an issue before. She now told me that she doesn't trust me, and doesn't think she will be able to sleep in the same house as me...

She walked out, still yelling and shouting, and I told my father that I think it is essentially bullshit what she is doing, but all he does is nod and agree with her and say 'I need to stay on the same page as her. That's what a marriage is.'

TITLE: TIFU by assuming the toilets in my building were ""fits it ships"" toilets
POST: This happened a few months ago...

I'm a grad student, so I work most weekends. This is important later. Over the summer, I had made it a habit of going poo in the second floor bathroom. It's a single toilet and the best in the building. Knowing I could easily clog my home toilet during my healthy eating binge and having heard from my male friends of the industrial flushing power of the campus toilets, I decided to make using this toilet my routine.

Until the fuck up. This one particular poo did not fit nor ship, thus rendering the toilet useless. It was a Friday afternoon, and the cleaning crew doesn't come in on the weekends. And Monday was a holiday. Ugh. Oh well, I thought. I still had the men's room. Weekends weren't busy, so I wasn't concerned.

Saturday comes around and I use the men's bathroom as a backup. It didn't fit nor ship on Saturday, either. After that, I had to walk to the opposite side of the building and down a floor to use the bathroom until Thursday because they had to call a professional plumber...
TL;DR: ","I took two massive poos and clogged two industrial toilets, eliminating everyone's toilet access on that floor for almost a week."

TITLE: After finishing Week 3 Day 3 of C25K I am noticing an unintended benefit of my new lifestyle....(x-post from r/C25K)
POST: Every day of this week, I have pushed myself to increase my pace while doing the workout. I am running on a treadmill since I already have a gym membership so I can measure exactly how much faster I am going. I went from day 1 at 6.5 miles per hour to Day 2 at 6.7mph and then today all my run intervals were at 7mph. Even though each workout is the same, I found that this keeps it challenging instead of resorting back to the idea that its something I've already achieved.

So here's the unintended part: I have noticed that with my continued success in losing weight, dieting properly, and keeping to my exercise goals that my confidence in myself is going up. I know that is to be expected but its also effecting my ability to be better in other areas of my life that I never could stick with like my hygiene, my schedule, my budget, keeping in touch with people, etc etc. It's like seeing that when I am determined to do something I can achieve is pushing me to reassess those other things and know that I can improve them too. I get more enjoyment out of striving to be an all around better adult and improving myself now so I have seen much more improvement in all aspects of my life. It's a great feeling as there things have been nagging me for years.

POST: We will call her Rita. Rita and I have been friends for almost 5 years. During the beginning of our friendship she had told me that she was recovering from depression but it had gotten a lot better. Throughout our friendship there are a few things I have noticed about her. 

1.	She is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.

2.	 I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)
In regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.

He just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)

3.	I found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.

I haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself. Well last night she called me to see if I wanted to get some coffee with her. I agreed but I'm not sure If it's my place to bring up that I think she needs professional help, or if recommending it would be a good idea.

However, before I was able to follow through, Paypal used the bank account to withdraw funds from Christmas shopping. This was maddening because it was my secondary account and not my primary.

TITLE: TIFU by starting an oil fire in my kitchen
POST: This fuck up happened a couple years ago before I knew of reddit and now I feel compelled to share it. 

So it was new years eve and my husband and I didn't have much food in the house. So I decided to make some homemade potato chips to munch on while we watched a movie. I used a pot and heated up some oil. The chips turned out okay I can never seem to cut them thin enough. I turned off the stove and returned to the couch to watch our movie. 

So the kitchen in my apartment was hiding behind a corner, so there was no way we could have noticed the flames any sooner. 

I see a ominous orange glow coming from the kitchen so I casually walk over and turn the corner and...
OH SHIT! FIRE! FIRE!

I literally panic like an idiot. And thank goodness my husband was there to take care of the situation otherwise I would have surely burnt down the apartment. Turns out I hadn't turned off the burner, but had left it on the highest setting.

So my husband bolts into the kitchen and grabs the  pot of oil that has ignited. With some quick thinking he grabs a nearby pan and attempts to smother the flames whilst running out of the kitchen towards the door. I open the door and finally in the breezeway of the apartment complex my husband tames the fire.

There was black soot coated on the vent hood of the stove and my pan was destroyed. I am just glad I didn't start the new year by burning down the apartment.

Last year he got arrested for beating up one of our 17 yo bussers. He will pretty much do anything he can get away with. All of our kitchen and now bussers are illegal immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador. These dudes are the hardest working chillest bros out there. Favorite people in the restaurant by far. I've even learned semi-fluent spanish from them. My biggest deterrent to reporting my boss for an array of abusive actions, is my concern all my buddies will get deported or something. The servers tip out the bussers every night yet the bussers never see this money. When i confronted the manager she informed me it was used to pay their hourly wage. Our carry-out guy gets tips from time to time directly from the customer. I learned today that he has to give those tips to the owner and the credit card tips are just ignored by him. They tried to tell me the same thing when i covered for the carry out guy this morning. I confronted them then, and was told i could talk about it later when the carry out guy wasn't around.

TITLE: Living with Negativity....26M
POST: Alright so here is the quick and dirty
Me - 26 M
Her - 32 F
Married 2 years this July.
Together 5 years this October.

When we first moved in together I had alot of things that I had to work on as far as being a better husband and communicating with her better, doing my part around the house etc.  Each time it was brought up it devolved into fighting but we figured that this wasn't working so devised a solution, a list!

This worked, my behaviours changed for the betterment of the relationship and myself and I feel like a better person for it.

Now me, I am a generally positive individual, I try my best to maintain a relatively positive outlook on things and just be humorous.  When it comes to serious stuff I am serious but otherwise I love to smile!

The issue I am having now is that we have been having ongoing discussions for the past 6 or so months about her attitude which has been getting progressively worse.  She is employed, currently paying down her student loans and stuck with a job that she hates while she does so.  Understandably not the best situation but I am always here for her and to support her, I've helped her get her food blog started, helped her get the implements for her baking etc.  

Instead of a happier more positive wife I have someone who constantly looks at the negatives, refuses to discuss our future together because it is depressing and just in general has issues showing emotion.

We have discussed this time and again, I'm getting sick of it, she is too and I'm just not seeing much improvement.

I love her, I care for her but for my own mental health I am having difficulty wanting to actually spend time with her when it feels like she just hates life.

Kind of a can't see the forest through the trees kind of thing.

I'm open to any suggestions Reddit may have on this.

TITLE: Our kitty is so picky, we've given in.
POST: Our rescue cat, Abby, has always been picky with food. When we first got her, she was quite ill and didn't like to eat anyway so that was even more difficult. Every time we think she likes a food, she stops eating it within a week and won't eat it again (Only after we have bought a months supply...).  

The thing is, we've tried to out-stubborn the cat, and it was a game of chicken we were never going to win.  And then came kitty number two, Ollie, who is just the jabba the hutt of kitties.

Not only will Ollie eat any left over food in Abby's bowl, but Abby doesn't want it and actively gives it to her baby sister.  It got so bad that Abby was vomiting clear bile out of hunger at night... we tried separating them, getting new foods, giving dry food to snack on... it was no use, she didn't eat. Before anyone asks, she HAS been to the vet and they just said she's picky.

Fast forward to us getting a gift pack from our vet for the baby when we took Abby in to see if there is a problem. It has royal canin weaning kitty food, and we thought we'd see if Ollie liked it. Guess who likes it? Abby. It is kitty crack cocaine I don't know. We started sprinkling it on top of normal cat food, and guess what.. she eats it. It's like a seasoning.

So here is our doubt, is this ok to do? The vet seemed really passive about it, and I don't know how good this is to do. I looked up its ingredients and it almost seems just like a vitamin packed dry food. We are sprinkling so she doesn't eat more than a a few grams.

When we met, we clicked. Our sense of humor aligned, we both have the same views on religion and politics, and never ran out of things to talk about over the course of the day. (We went hiking and picnicking, so we were together for about 7 hours on a Saturday.) At the end of the night, there was a perfect first kiss, then some making out later, and talks of a ""next time.""

We texted back and forth a little on Sunday, and then Monday I get radio silence. He finally texts me back these one word answers, and then eventually just stops responding. I check on Facebook to see if there's anything going on (as he's a fairly active user and uses Facebook a little like Twitter) only to find out I've been unfriended. 

That was two days ago, and I'm afraid I've been a mess ever since (I know it's silly to get attached that quickly, but we had in depth conversations over the course of two weeks and I've always worn my heart on my sleeve anyway.) I know it's over, I just have no idea why. He gave me no indication that anything was wrong, and if going on that date with me was just acting then he deserves an Oscar. 

Do I reach out to him again for closure? I don't want to be the clingy girl that can't take a hint, but I'm kind of heartbroken that I don't at least know WHY.

My son's mother was/is the best friend I've ever had. Sometimes relationships have their issues so we divorced. We have stayed friends and have been able to be a part of their lives. 

Around the end of June and beginning of July she started to date someone seriously.  All I wanted for her was to be happy, which she was. At the end of July she told me she needed to speak with me. We met for lunch and the first words out of her mouth were, ""You're going to hate me."" At that point she told me her new boyfriend didn't want her seeing me, but that it was her choice. She then told me I wouldn't be able to see my son, who I would see at least once a week to hang out, work on homework, or use the season tickets we had to one of the local sports teams.  Afterwards, she told me she would re-evaluate the situation in four months and that I would be able to see my stepson one more time to speak with him (under the supervision of his aunt). After the meeting she blocked me on all social media and had my son do the same.

I was devastated because I had lost two of my best friends. 
The last 16 weeks have been some of the most difficult I've ever faced. I contacted my son's aunt and she told me her sister hadn't told her anything about the agreement of seeing my son and that she didn't want to get involved. I'm fine with that, I don't want to cause any rifts with her family. 

This Monday will be the end of four months. I have some ideas on how I should approach the situation but I would like anyone's opinion on how to proceed.

TITLE: I am a fucking dumbass who can't read numbers
POST: I mixed up two of the digits when I sent the text message.

I am in a student organization that helps build primary and secondary schools in rural areas in Honduras. I went on a week long service trip last winter and it was the most amazing week of my life. I can't describe why, but being in this organization and working towards my fundraising goal has been just about the most important and fulfilling thing in my life over the last year or so.

I was supposed to head back to Honduras in 5 days. For now I am home from college over winter break. I noticed last week that I made the colossal mistake of leaving my passport at my college apartment (~5 hrs away). Thankfully, I had a roommate still there who could mail it to me. With over 10 business days before leaving on my trip at the time, I figured mailing it was not much of a risk (I realize now how stupid this reasoning is).

Of course, today, I checked back over my text conversation with my roommate and noticed I got the fucking address wrong. 2 numbers swapped places. I don't know if I read it wrong or typed it in wrong. The address I sent does not exist. I am a fucking aerospace engineering student but I can't fucking read a fucking 5 digit number apparently. 

I am lost for options at this point. It will be near impossible to track it down (it's in an envelope, no tracking #). It will most certainly be returned to my college apartment too late to get in time for my flight.

I realize that this only happened because of a special series of idiotic errors that only I am capable of. I have wasted a years worth of fundraising, over a thousand dollars worth. I spent so many mornings at bake sales and sponsored events. I worked so hard and now I will spend the week at home feeling sorry for myself. I want to crawl under a rock and die.

TITLE: How do I [21F] break up with my BF [21M] of two years? First relationship.
POST: It's over. 

It hurts to admit it, but it's true. We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. 

There's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). 

It's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. 

What do I say? I don't want to hurt him. I've been putting this off because I don't want to have to go through the stress of one of us moving out or explaining to his parents (who treat me like a daughter). How do I even bring it up? I have never done this before and I don't know how. 

Also- my biggest fear- will I regret it? 

Thank you for any advice or comforting words.

TITLE: I (24) have found out my bf's (25) mother abandoned their family. How do I be supportive?
POST: I am in a new relationship (4 months) and discovered through my boyfriend's friend that his mother abandoned their family when he was very young. One of his friends let this slip to me after a few drinks at a party. My boyfriend has not told me yet.

Previously I knew there has been no contact with his mom and the subject is very touchy. I haven't pushed him to reveal anything. We had spoken about our pasts before, he was upset but said in time he will be able to tell me things and I am ok waiting for him to share. 

He's also been hurt in former relationships and I think this has really affected him being open with me as he avoids in-depth or emotional conversations.

I come from a family where my parents are still together and have no idea how to approach this or help him feel more at ease with me. I care about him very much and want to make this work. Any help is appreciated.

TITLE: I need some advice about a few things
POST: The whole starting point of everything happened when my dad walked out on my mum after cheating. It's been an extremely messy and complicated divorce that is still not settled 4 years later. My dad has depression and has some perceived victim complex when talking about the divorce to people - to some he will lie and act as if they are still together (he didn't even tell his own family, they found out by trying to contact him through us). To others he says how my mum is the one who cheated - but HE is the one who cheated. He has also been keeping secrets and lying for many years before he left. He has lied constantly throughout the court process and won't agree to settle anything because he wants to destroy my mum - even the mediator says his behaviour is absolutely fucked and can't understand why he won't just settle things. That is only some of it - but I don't speak to him at all anymore. He hasn't supported me one bit throughout this entire process or even tried to.

A knock on effect is that now my mum and sibling have depression as well. All 3 of my immediate family have depression and I do not.  It is very difficult to live with her sometimes and I don't know what to do.

Due to all of this my mum is now trying to support me and the pets we have (sibling moved out of home)singlehandedly but money is extremely  tight all of the time. Due to me being over 18, my dad is not legally required to help me at all... It creates a lot of stress and I did have a job but lost it due to no hours for me. Now I have zero income. I am trying to get through uni - 4/5 days a week 1h30mins away, and do 5:30 starts most mornings leaving me somewhat sleep deprived. Moving is out of the question due to combined home circumstances, but the fuel cost is really difficult. I have only got the work experience of the job I just lost - 3 months weekend casual worker.

TITLE: Me [15 F] with my ex-bf [15 M] 2 months, having trouble letting go after getting dumped
POST: Basically I was dating another guy (John) for a year- not bad for a first relationship- but he broke up with me in a pretty harsh way (just dumped me out of the blue on the first day back to school. I was a wreck for months). Then my new ex (Mike) comes along, and kinda lifts me back out from my depression-esque mentality. So we're both attracted to each other, but I was scared to date Mike because I didn't think I could go through anotehr breakup. But after a while, I finally relented cuz I couldn't bear to see him with other people, and he kinda said, ""If we break up, I'll make you hate me or something so it'll hurt less."" Either way, we got together, but I was a bit clingy and needed a lot of his time, so he said he couldn't deal with it. Broke up with me gently, and said we could stay friends (we were pretty good friends in that period where he was helping me get over John). Now I want to be friends again, but I feel like I'm trying too hard. Also I still like him, and it's only been... about exactly a week. I've actually just started no contact for about 3 hours (shoulda done it right away I know, but it was hard), but I already feel like shit. 

Any advice? I need to let go and stop making a fool out of myself, especially because we have so many classes together. I can't keep my eyes off him and everyone says it's creepy. Help!

TITLE: I know my girlfriend [18/F] of 9 months cares, but she just doesn't put in any effort and I [20/M] am sick of it...worth breaking up over?
POST: Been seeing this girl since November, she is so much fun, absolutely gorgeous and very well-intentioned...but I think she's just fucking lazy. I'll ask her out and get turned down because her parents won't let her, she has work, she has uni or she's with other friends, to the point where I've stopped trying.

Part of the issue is me, because I'm too spiteful and refuse to be the one always asking. I asked two friends out to lunch today and just didn't bother asking my own girlfriend, simply because there was like an 80% chance she'd say no for whatever reason and I'd get pissed off.

I tried to break up with her a few months ago for the same reason, really, and I've had words with her about it since too. I know she cares, I know that I mean a lot to her and she doesn't want to lose me...but she just doesn't show it at all [when she's not with me]. When we're together everything is really good, great even. We have heaps of fun and clearly love each other's company. But once we part ways, it might be for the whole week despite us living like a 20 minute drive away, and 90% of the time we'll only see each other if I keep asking.

I've had this issue for a while but have told myself I'll wait until the end of August since by then we'll have had a few weeks with her parents out of the picture to see if the relationship actually changes, but I don't know if I can even hang in that much longer. I asked her to come over on Thursday since I hadn't seen her for a week and had been away - she was going to be at work that night and my place is closer than hers from there - but no, she was ""too tired"" to stay with me.

Since I've brought it up before and nothing's really changed, should I even go through the same speech again? I want to love this girl but I just spend so much of my time being pissed off.

POST: I [27F] have been seeing a new guy, John [30M] for a month and a half. We see each other once a week, often on weekends, and text each other every day after work, usually telling the other one what our day has been like. He is the one initiating the conversation most of the time; not sure if it's relevant, but just saying in case it is. We didn't have the exclusivity talk yet.

Yesterday he initiated the conversation again and started telling me about this woman at work who wanted to set him him up with someone. I asked him if she showed him pictures of the woman in question. He replied: ""Yes, she looks terrible. **I lied** and said I just started seeing someone.""

I am very upset because of the ""I lied"" part of the sentence but didn't tell him anything about it yet. He didn't seem to be joking at all.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that our first date was outside and awesome and lasted six hours but that the dates after were mostly dinner at his place.

Do you believe he is seeing me as a fuck buddy and thinks I'm cool with it, or is there any chance that he is testing the waters to see how I am going to be reacting to his behavior?

So far everything has been really good, no problems, and we planned last night to meet up for lunch during my 12-1 break today. We texted and had unrelated conversation this morning, then at 12 I left class to go meet him.

By 12:30 I'm pretty pissed off, and a friend passes by so I accompany him to lunch and text the guy id been planning to meet that I had to leave to get food since I had class at 1.  He responds about 10 minutes later with something along the lines of ""sorry, I'm awful, I got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time"". I haven't said anything yet. 

I'm pretty angry, and those who know me in person know that I never get angry about anything. I don't know what to do. I really liked him and things had been going really well.

For some reason, we thought it would be a great idea to try that, only we couldn't find a penny, so we decided to try to flatten a dime. Shockingly, dimes and pennies are made of different materials, so we weren't making much progress, but like good little elementary school kids, we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house. When it was my friend's turn, I noticed Roosevelt's face was angled about 40 degrees away from her, and for some reason it seemed really crucial that he be facing her dead on, so I rotated the dime. I was a neurotic, whiny kid, so when my mom heard me crying, she assumed it was something minor and came out rolling her eyes before she saw all the blood. Luckily, I didn't break any bones, but I had a cool hangnail with which to gross out all the boys on the bus for the next few weeks.

POST: Now, I don't really even know where to begin with this. I'm a 20 year old woman and I believe i'm a great person, but I just can figure out why men aren't interested in me unless they're just trying to hook up. I've had my fair share of hook ups, but never with someone i've just randomly met and i've continued to have good friendships with these men without having any desire to make a relationship out of it.

I am a full time student trying to get my degree, even doing that I have plenty of time to myself for other activities. I also am a mother. Sure I had my child young, but it's the one thing that changed my life for the better. I was not in school pre child and now my life has come together more than I ever could have hoped for. My child's father and I have a great friendship, and that's all it is. We co-parent very well together. Thus also leading me to have lots of time for myself as our time with our child is split 50/50.

I'd like to think that i'm a great person with a great personality. I enjoy pretty much anything and would be willing to experience new things. I've also always been told that i'm a very attractive woman. Now what am I missing here? I definitely don't need a man to make me happy, as I already am. I just know that i'd love to have that person who makes my life a little brighter.

Some of the men that i've been involved with recently (but not too recently) or interested in always seem to find a way out and I can't help but think it's either something to do with the fact that I already have a child or it's just something about me. I have my entire life in order. I live in my own home, no debt, I attend college and am very close to getting my degree. If  I can tell you one thing from that is that I have my life in FAR better order than most people my age and in my situation. Much better than most of my friends too.

So, any advice would help. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for, but it's something.

POST: 22M, Girlfriend is 21F. We've been together for a year and a half. Her best friend is gay. At first I was uncomfortable with him since I don't know that many gay people, but the more I hung out with him (only a few times) the more comfortable I've been with him. We have complete trust in each other. Girlfriend actually went out with him when they were in high school together, then he cheated on her and then that's when he came out of the closet. They've remained best friends and like to go to gay clubs together. I feel this problem would be less of an issue if I went with them, but I work really late 5 days a week, (til 3am on weekends).

My only problem with him is how much he likes to drink which I feel like has an influence on her. I've brought that up to her but she says she will only keep drinking when she wants to. When she would instagram pictures of them together hanging at the club or wherever it made me feel uneasy. I felt it was unhealthy to feel that way and getting addicted to seeing what she would post so I stopped going on instagram completely. 

The reason why I get jealous is because I feel like she has more fun when it's just him and her vs me and her since he makes her laugh so much. Does anyone have any advice for learning to accept the idea that it's okay that maybe she does have fun with him more, since he is her best friend and all..

They're both musicians.  He really likes her and wants to be able to hang out with her after work, like grabbing a beer with her.  I know he texts her sometimes outside of work hours but not sure how often or what about (he's pretty secretive with his phone).  It makes me super uncomfortable and he knows this. 

 We had a pretty big blowout a few months ago when she was throwing a party and I asked him not to go.  He thinks I'm totally irrational about her and gets angry whenever I try to talk to him about this.  He was going to go to the party regardless of how I felt about it so we ended up going together and it was fine.  

I have tried to just drop it since the party.  I feel like he knows how I feel and that's all I can really do.  He hasn't been going for drinks with her or anything, which I appreciate.   I have recently found out, though, that this woman has a reputation for being a ""home wrecker.""  My husband said it's because she went one a date with her married friend while he was separated from his wife.  This is making me feel even more uneasy about her and my husband's friendship.  I know rumor mills can get carried away, especially in a small town.  But I can't help but feel a little justified in wanting them to not be friends now that I know this.

More relevant information.... My first marriage ended because he met someone else.  So it's entirely possible I'm over reacting about this situation because of that.  I've been in therapy for over three years and feel like I've made great strides.  My husband occasionally goes to therapy with me but it hasn't been very helpful.

We've had five dates so far and everything has been quite well except for her abusive ex of 8 months getting involved. She had broken up with him about 4 months ago and I was her first venture back into the dating scene. As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.

Shortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number. The two times we've spoken he told me in a very threatening manner that he happens to have friends in various biker gangs and doesn't appreciate me seeing her. He then gave me an ultimatum to either stop seeing her OR to not set foot into ""his city"". I've only talked to him for 30 minutes or so; but I've come to the conclusion that he isn't the most mentally stable individual.

I sucked it up and accepted her apology and have been dealing with it ever since. This is about the time I registered her phone with the Find My Iphone service.
Fast forward to Monday night- I get texts form her saying she was going out to pick us up some food. I come home from work late around 7pm and she is not home. she wont answer my calls or texts. I know where she is cause I pulled up Find My Iphone website and she is at the local bar down the street. I wait for 3 hours and finally get a text of her saying she was at her girlfriends house and she will be home soon. LIAR! I had enough and stormed off to confront her at the bar. Didn't see the car she was driving in the parking lot so I'm starting to think im wrong, But there it is parked IN THE BACK. as if to hide from me.
I found her and a guy she works with (restaurant, typical for sleeping with coworkers).
Now we are a mess and Im about to throw her out and start my life over, Sucks cause I wanted to marry this one.
She doesn't know I tracked her with the iPhone. And I don't think Ill ever trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex? In my eyes she lied to be with another guy while i was at work and that's cheating in my book.

TITLE: [F29] Is there something in between casual sex and LTR?
POST: Three years ago I ended a 6 yr relationship, and it left me with a lot of trust issues. A few months after the split, my ex felt he needed to ""clear the air"" so that we could have a chance at reconciling. That involved my learning I had been completely oblivious to cheating, lying, and an arrest (yup, he went to jail for a few days and I had no idea). I know what you're thinking, that I am just super dumb. I wish that was the case, I'm college educated and have a professional career, just plain old gullible. In the aftermath, I have spent a year having exclusive relationships, the next having one night stands, and the last online dating. For the record online dating does nothing to improve trust issues, I had on guy tell me he slept with Cameron Diaz and another try to steal a set of golf clubs (and those are just the gems). 

This afternoon the guy I have been seeing on and off for the last six months finally agreed to keep things casual. Now, I am free to date and see whomever I choose, and am contemplating whether I want to go the online route again. My casual relationships thus far have involved ignoring lies because the details aren't important. This isn't one sided, I fib about where I am when I'm out with other guys. Unfortunately, when I notice them my history and fear makes ignoring feel self-deprecating, and I struggle to forgive myself for ages after the bad ones.  On the other hand, I am just not ready for the LTR I want, one missed text or phone call and I flip, but I'm not attracted to someone who caters to my every wish in the long term. So Reddit, I need suggestions on what to do next. 

- Side Note – During this last relationship I was in a place to tell my SO about how scared of lies I am and it got a lot better, so I know that in time it will get easier.

POST: I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying ""I'm a TV watcher"" or ""music listener."" Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with ""gamers.""

""CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell."" 

This hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because ""that's what casuals play."" The whole PC master race also irritates me. Who really gives a shit what someones console preference is?

I can't even finish my rant. It frustrates me that I ever called myself a gamer as a kid anyway. It's just so dumb.
TL;DR: ","it's about overused memes, politics, and inside jokes, not the act of gaming itself. It's not niche anymore so stop acting like you're part of some cool subculture. What's the point, anyway?"

POST: Hello, 

I'm a 16y/o male and im in love with a girl [16]. This is the first time i'm in love and it is really exchausting. I am 100% sure i am not ready for a relation yet and i don't want it either. I almost never talk with her so our relationship is non existing. Another thing is that someone else also likes her and it keeps getting in my head because they regularly chill with each other.

I met this [F23], Elizabeth (pseudonym), last year at university while she and I were in a one year program together - we never met prior to this. We spent the better part of a year in close proximity, having mutual friends and hanging out. From the moment I saw her I was attracted - she was smart and pretty. Unfortunately, I could never get myself to ask her out. A part of me kept saying she's not interested because I never talked to her everyday, just whenever there was the occasional get together with mutual friends would there be some small talk. With the program over since last December 2014, I have never been able to get her off my mind. I have her on Facebook and I have her cell phone number, but I've never messaged her. I really want to ask her out, but I don't know what to do. Also, she lives in a different city than I do (~45 mins away). What should I do? Your help is greatly appreciated.

POST: 24,M / 23,F

In two of my previous relationships, I was the jealous type and have greatly learned my lesson from being that way. I am currently in a 2 year relationship in which my girlfriend and I live together. I love her, but because of things I've experienced, I am no longer the jealous type. I won't let myself behave like that again. She gets upset with me because I don't get jealous. Don't get me wrong, if a guy were to touch her I'd knock him out. But she tells me that it makes her feel like I don't take pride in her or value her because I don't get jealous that another guy might think she's attractive or something. Am I downplaying jealousy too much? I don't feel that there is anything healthy about jealousy in a relationship, but it seems she does.

So guy meets girl and they exchange numbers, talk and flirt all that jazz. They keep trying to organise a date but both are really busy. She suddenly decides to comes cover to guys house late one night, stays the night because he lives close to her work. They have sex.

TITLE: Do American kids have a ""dinosaur phase""?
POST: I'm from New Zealand. It's pretty much a secular country, ie politicians speaking about God is a big no-no. A lot of people are Christian but for the most part they are not fundamentalists, and most of them believe in evolution. Evolution is taught in science class in high school.

As a kid in New Zealand, pretty much every boy (and probably some girls) go through a ""dinosaur phase"", where they are really into dinosaurs. Their parents buy them dinosaur toys and book and computer games. The primary appeal is obviously the fact that dinosaurs are awesome giant scary monsters, but they also end up learning about the Cretaceous period and the Jurassic period and how many millions of years ago the dinosaurs lived.

So I read that [almost half of the American population doesn't believe in evolution] Coming from a scientific background, this just seems absolutely insane to me. Regardless of what you believe, the [body of evidence for evolution] is enormous enough that a person who denies it is denying fact and reason. But I don't want this is to turn into an evolution debate.

My question is, if a large portion of America doesn't believe in evolution, then do they still let their kids learn about dinosaurs? Do the kids still have a ""dinosaur phase""? I know Creationists have a few ways of [justifying dinosaurs without evolution] but it just seems to me that the topic of dinosaurs is something that most Creationist parents would want to sweep under the carpet. I don't know.

Caveat: I know things are different in different states and different communities. If you don't want to generalise, tell me about your specific upbringing.

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of one year, I can't figure out if we should stay together or not.
POST: So I have no doubt that I love my boyfriend. We've had a really tough first year. Lots of short break ups. I've been dealing with a new anxiety problem and its been tough on both of us. 

At one point we broke up long enough that I met someone very interesting, went on a date, had the best sex of my life. I remembered what it felt like to be lusted after or wanted.

Ever since that break I can't decide if I want to be with him or be single. What I love about being single is feeling wanted. I know my bf loves me but he never lusts for me. If I ever have doubts he never fights for our relationship. He tells me he just wants me to be happy, but if he showed some passion towards being with me it would fufil that need to be wanted. 

Also our relationship is kind of stagnate. Were both in the same exact situation as last year. I'm worried that he isn't focused enough on becoming successful. 

But our relationship provides love, comfort, support, the best friendship I've ever had, openness. These things I know I won't find from dating. And these things are so important for me. 

For some reason feeling wanted makes me feel like I'm at my best. I'm the most confident I can be. I feel good. And this need is enough to make me doubt wanting to be in my relationship. I literally cannot decide which is more important to me.

TITLE: How do I [24M] move forward with live-in SO [34F]?
POST: The points: 

* I work in IT and am a pretty solitary guy, having her in my life makes me so much more at ease.  I have general anxiety so this is important.  

* I've never really felt ""love"" from anyone but her, I had a messed up childhood so having someone this close to me is new and exciting

* My college days were relatively intense, I'm yearning for the excitement of being single again but don't want to hurt SO, I'm constantly thinking about peers my age, eyes always wandering, not sexually attracted to SO anymore

* She's from another country on a student visa, been living with me for 8 months.  she moved in because she was living with 6 other girls in a 2br place, all worked at the same whip-wielding restaurant to pay for school

* Obviously hurting someone sucks and the feeling of being alone is terrifying (new city, no close friends)... but I do feel trapped, like I could be growing a lot more.  Was formerly polyamorous, jumped into this on impulse.  

* I told her I never intend on getting married or having kids.  She accepted that, we've been monogamous for 18 months 

* she doesn't know many other people so I offer some level of security, but taking that away by breaking up would ruin a big part of her life, she might go back home

Proposals from both sides of the political spectrum say that a reduction of spending is needed (with democrats proposing raising taxes in the upper braket?) but how big of a chunk of an anual budget would really be needed to put a dent in 14 trillion? You dont accumulate that kind of debt over night and i have difficulty seeing exactly how any reduction could even allow them to break even let alone start reducing this debt load given the rather large deficit administrations have been running.

POST: Last summer I met a girl online who we'll call Jo. Jo had just moved to my city, and we met up and became friends. I introduced her to my friends and she started coming to our group get togethers.

Over the months, I started realizing that Jo was extremely high maintenance and controlling. I felt like every few weeks she would be angry at me about something trivial.

The final straw was when I offered to introduce her to one of my single guy friends. She asked me to find out if he was interested. Unfortunately he was not, and when I told her this she took it out on me like it was somehow my fault. That was the final straw. I felt like our friendship was toxic and told her that she was too demanding and I couldn't be friends anymore. This was about three weeks ago.

I didn't tell any of my friends in the group (except for one because I sought her advice) because I didn't know what to do. Now I feel like she's doubled how much she's hanging out with my friends and I am going to run into her this weekend.

She says they are just friends but it doesnt ease my mind much. And I know she doesnt mean any harm by it. She's an attention craver.

I feel like this shouldnt be a big issue but I have a lot of insecurities when it comes to girls texting other guys. Ive had bad relationship exprriences with this in the past. Anyway my first instinct is to badger her about it. Asking things like, ""whos that?"" or ""is that a guy?"". Its just the way I am to be nosy like that but its not good.

My sister dropped out of university after one semester two years ago. She's been living with my parents since then. She goes to a community college, but she has failed most of her classes there. She has almost no friends, and she spends most of her time alone in her room. She is very into anime, cosplay, MLP, and is now making a 'fursuit'. I'm very concerned about her. She seems to have no goals, dreams, or ambition and she keeps falling into weirder and weirder crowds. I've suggested that my parents kick her out into a student apartment, so that she will be surrounded by other girls her age. 

She will be 21 soon, on her way to adulthood, and she has shown no sign of growing up. She finally got her first minimum wage job about a month ago. My parents have saved up around 20K for her college fund, so she has the resources to go to college, but she cannot seem to pass her classes. She began taking Vyvanse for ADHD a few months ago, but I do not know if that has made any improvement. She has had boyfriends, but every one of them has been jealous and abusive.

She had an extremely abusive boyfriend a few years ago, who apparently beat and raped her before my parents got her out of that relationship. She has been in counseling because of that, and was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. I'm sitting here with my Mom and we're pretty much at a loss here on how to handle this.

TITLE: Thinking about therapy, implications for employment? Specifically: Peace Corps.
POST: I've been thinking about seeking some type of therapy (most likely CBT) for awhile now to help me deal with some social anxiety and negative thinking issues for some time. I've never done this sort of thing before and while I think I'm doing pretty well in bettering myself on my own, I'd like to make more progress and get an outside opinion on some things.

My concern is that if I seek therapy, and use my insurance to help pay for it, that this information could somehow be used against me when looking for employment. I just submitted an application to the Peace Corps and as part of that application it asked if I had ever seen a psychologist and if so, the date I saw them last. I answered no, which is true, but if I now go see a therapist and don't tell them, then I'm likely breaking rules that if they found out, could lead to my termination (and I guess possibly fines/jail).

POST: We were together for almost 2 years at uni, and we even lived together. But I moved across the world for a year abroad of uni, and after about 3 months the strain became too much. 

We mutually broke up, and we were both  ok. But afterwards I didn't take it well; I drunkenly text and rang him. So I decided to delete him off facebook to stop myself from embarrassing myself further. 

This didn't really work, and the last time we talked was when I tried to call sober to clear the air but he was angry that I was contacting him again. He said we'd talk in a few months when I was over it but I told him I didn't want to be friends.

That was a few weeks ago and I don't know what to do. I feel so awful that I have lost not only my boyfriend but my best friend, and the idea that we can't even be friends really saddens me. I know I was in the wrong and I was so over dramatic, but I feel this is mostly to do with the fact I'm not really enjoying my time abroad.

I kind of wish I'd never left my home country and him, I was happy there. I don't know what I expected to find here but I haven't.
Should I just leave this and move on?
TL;DR: ","Mutual break-up that I grew to regret, then I was too childish meaning I have lost him even as a friend. What should I do?"

TITLE: Me[18M/F] with my ___ [18M/F] duration, short-description
POST: [Previous Post](

---

So I snooped again because I saw a text pop up from him last week on her phone.

Last Saturday night, she texted him out of the blue just before 10pm saying ""what u up to tonight?"". This is a week after he last texted her and she didn't respond. This was in a 20 min gap when she wasn't with me. She was drunk too.

She then met up with me shortly after at 10pm so didn't respond to any of his texts for the rest of the night/she got too drunk to function and I had to take her home.

The rest of his texts were about asking her to meet up etc with last text being at 1am. This is when I saw the text as I was still up and her phone was on the table. I decided not to snoop further at that stage.

She hasn't text back since then.

I know all of this because I only decided to snoop last night because it's been bugging me ever since. She got blind drunk last night so I had to meet up with my mate and her on the street and help her get home. She was in memory blank drunk mode. On a work night too. Which just made me think wtf is going on with her so I snooped when she was passed out.

Also remembered something she said to me a few weeks ago, she said

""I used to text other guys when I was with my past boyfriends, because basically I got bored, but with you I don't have to because you're so fun"" or something like that.

And ever since she said that it's been in the back of my mind, contributing to my insecurity, and has me thinking oh is this the start of this sort of behavior.

I think you guys are right that I don't trust. And I have to admit it too. I don't trust her that much at the moment due to her behavior and my insecurities.

TITLE: TIFU by zoning out and burning myself
POST: This fuck up happened less than 30 minutes ago... do I get a prize?

Background: I am a high school student and I generally pride myself for being part of the upper group as far as intelligence is concerned, but after my fuck up, I have been considerably humbled. 

The Fuck Up: I was in chemistry today and we were doing a lab. In this particular lab we were using a little bowl called a crucible.  The crucible was still wet after being washed at the end of the last class, therefore the first instruction was to heat it over a burner to dry it out. 

We heated the crucible for the required two minutes and sat it at the table to cool, as it was cooling I began to read the instructions for the next step, which required us to find its  mass. My mind had begun to wander from the lab, when I remembered what needed to be done. I promptly said ""Let me just mass this."" I grabbed the crucible. The blazing hot, just heated by fire for two minutes crucible. It burned, seeking to remove it from my hand and stop the pain. I flung it to the ground and it shattered. 

The looks I received from my teacher and the other students were those of bewilderment. They were bewildered at how I could be so stupid as to grab an incredibly hot crucible. I am shamed, and my burned finger hurts.
TL;DR: ","I forgot what I was doing and grabbed at very hot thing, I burned myself and got looks from other students that make me feel dumb."

TITLE: My[26M] fiancée [27F] is upset I stayed out late after a concert, I think she is over reacting.
POST: I am in a long distance relationship with my fiancée. I really like concerts, and go often. I went to a concert on Friday night, and meet an adorable couple at the show. We really hit it off with them. I liked him a lot, he was really cool, and she was really sweet/precious. We ended up staying out till 5 am and had a blast.

I normally text her when I am home, but apparently I passed out without properly hitting the button. (The message was all typed out and everything.) When I woke up at 9, I apologized for not texting her, because I know she wants me to be safe.

Last night, she basically said I was stupid and unsafe for doing what I did. I didn't know them, and I was not being smart. I told her that I really trusted them, and that they were harmless. She said she didn't care.

I have traveled the world. I have been to over 20 countries and backpacked with strangers for weeks, in the mountains. This makes me nervous that she thinks this was so dangerous, as this seems like such a small thing to me.

Am I thinking about this wrongly?

TITLE: Me [20m] and my ex [20f] broke up due to her parents beliefs.
POST: This had been going on most of our relationship (6 months) but her parents go to a Church of Christ and long story short, if I'm not on par with their religion, then I'm not allowed to date her. They've met me once and didn't see that I was good enough so it wasn't allowed no matter what she tried telling them.  She's suffocated by them and doesn't know where she is on religion due to them forcing it on her. She definitely doesn't agree with a lot of their beliefs. 

We have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for 6 months, and I still have that feeling I got the the first week we dated. Now she broke up with me because we have been hiding it the whole time and she started getting frustrated with lying and being scared of them figuring out because the consequences would be pretty great.

Neither her or I are in the position to move out so options on how this could work are very limited. Talking to them really isn't going to do anything because they're so deep in religion, that there's no if, ands, or buts. We're in a rough spot and are both really stressed out and would like to be together but them finding out would not be pretty. Does anyone have an suggestions or experience with this? It'd be MUCH appreciated as I'm very upset and just want this all better.

Thanks for reading.

TITLE: [m24] currently dating a very young girl
POST: Currently I'm in a pretty good relationship with a girl who is younger than the ""half your age plus 7"" rule. Actually she has just hit the age of consent (16) and we have been dating pretty seriously for 5 months. Honestly I felt pretty bad about it in the beginning because when I was younger I always despised older guys dating really young girls. Now I have become what I once hated.... 

I truly felt when I was going to first meet her Chris Hansen was going to show up with some cameras.

But no, we have not had any sexual relations yet. However, I can honestly say I do like her for much more than that. She is much more mature,  honest and straight forward than other girls my age, which I find really attractive.

She has also told me her mother met her dad at the age of 15, married 5 years later and were happy ever since. This gives me some kind of hope.

Do Parents Know?: Currently her mother is only aware that we ""talking"" but not the depth of the relationship. I know her mother personally since she is a friend of the family. However, I have not introduced myself as her daughter's companion yet. I would rather do the whole meet and greet the family when she turns 18.

I'm wondering if there are currently any other redditors out there that have had a similar (successful) experience?

We are currently in different cities for the summer but we'll be in the same city by September (where we both attend school).

TITLE: [19/m] I am in my freshman year of college with my girlfriend [18/f]. I am having an easier time adjusting and it's putting a strain on our relationship.
POST: I'll try to make this as brief as I can.

My girlfriend and I started dating during our junior year in high school and we ended up going to the same university. When we first moved in, we were both a bit overwhelmed, and it was really helpful to the both of us that we had each other during the transition. 

Since I have always adjusted pretty easily to new situations, I started to become pretty comfortable around week 3. I have gotten know a ton of people, I've made new friends and I've been doing very well in all my classes.

She, on the other hand, has been having a tougher time. She feels like she hasn't made any friends, is really struggling in her classes, and she's feeling pretty lost. I've been doing everything I can to be there for her, and spend all the time with her that I can, but it seems like we're on two different wavelengths.

One of the main reasons we're running into trouble is that since I'm meeting a ton of people and having a great time, she's worried that she's holding me back from everything. The thing is, I want to meet new friends and everything, but I wanna do it with her. I always try to get her to hang out with my friends, but she never seems happy. When I ask her why, she always says ""they're your friends, you all know each other.""

It's beginning to feel like I have to choose between her and my friends, and I don't want that. I love being with her, but it seems like lately, I'm all she has. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long post!

In a few years, I'll be leaving college with no debt. I've managed a very small part-time job in addition to being full time student ($2400 in 2012, which I will file taxes on!). I'm looking at ~$3000 for 2012, + an internship stipend (which won't be much).

I've been depositing my checks at a 2:1 Savings:Checkings ratio.

I don't have a car and I won't need one. My room and food is taken care of (I even managed to get free housing for the summer) while I'm in college, and my parents have offered me a (rent-free) couch while I'm job-searching post-graduation.

Basic goals for post-graduation:
Out of my parents' house by winter, into an apartment, with a job.
It's not very realistic, but some recent alum from my department have managed it.

Now usually when something goes wrong they take a couple days to come fix which isn't a big deal as long as its not something serious. Shortly after moving in we noticed mouse crap in the cabinets. Then we stated seeing them. We told maintenance and they came by and put traps down. We caught a good 3 or 4 mice. Then we started catching 1 every couple of weeks and seeing/hearing them every couple of days. The apartment management just kept on sending us traps. Now the mice seem to have had babies because we see mice multiple times a day and they are getting into all of my food. management seems to think that providing us traps is all they have to do and its our problem. This is a serious problem that traps won't fix. We need an exterminator but they clearly don't want to pay for one to come. But this is a health risk in my opinion.

Some back story. She had a boyfriend before me let's call him, John. She and John and a pretty rocky relationship from what I was told and witnessed myself. Anyway after a while they broke up and we got together and it was great. Fast forward to when I was away on holiday during Christmas 2012, she ends up seeing him and says how nothing happened between them. However after another incident in August she let me read through her texts and I found one from that day saying ""Last night can't mean nothing. What was i thinking. Im not that type of person"" And then a day or so after he sent something saying ""Sorry about your neck"" (she was big on biting necks and loves it done to her too)

So yeah she says she didn't sleep with him when she told me about this when it happened. But I don't think I believe her just because how she's lied to me in the past about seeing him and especially after reading those messages. Should I bring it up with her somehow or what?

POST: So I'm a student at a university and I've seen a girl around a few times from a distance who I thought was absolutely gorgeous. Since she is in a sorority and me a fraternity, I know a lot of her friends and when I asked them about her they were quick to tell me she's the perfect girl personality wise for me. So, one of our mutual friends who is really close to this girl told her about me and told me she wanted to meet me, gave me her number, and said it would be okay to text her so I did. We had a decent conversation going and it abruptly stopped. It was late, she probably fell asleep. So I followed the double texting rule and waited three days to try to reach out again. After I got the conversation going I asked her if she would like to meet me for coffee and she said she wouldn't be able to that week because of how busy she was with a weeklong philanthropy event. Even though she kept the conversation going for a while (that abruptly stopped again) I took it as a rejection and decided I wouldn't press it again. After that, I told another mutual friend who sits next to her in class and she said she actually was really busy with this philanthropy event and not to take it personal and that she'd talk to her about relationships without mentioning my name. So they talked and this girl told her a guy had been mean to her and she wanted to focus on school.

TITLE: We did it! Review + Pictures!
POST: My husband (!!) and I tied the knot April 9th, we planned every little detail ourselves and paid for it ourselves. (Well with some help from my parents). And all decor was DIY'D. It was a LONG year and a half, but seeing it all come together was worth it!

Some things that went well...

* Seeing my husband's face during our first look. He bawled like a baby and it was the most treasured moment of the whole day and probably my whole life. 

* Our officiant killed it! We had guest after guest comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, some said it was the most emotional wedding they'd ever been too. And a friend's mom said our vows made her question her marriage (yeah, that was a weird comment). But it was worth it to custom curate our ceremony with our officiant, it was so special and even though I was so nervous I'm glad we wrote our own vows. 

Things that went wrong...

* My father in law hit my day of coordinator's car before the ceremony... I didn't find out about it until we checked into our hotel that night. But during our first dance it was funny to hear my husband go ""I have so much to tell you..."" Everything was fine though! He just scraped the side of her truck with his, but she handled it like a PRO. She just told him well, today is you son's day so we'll exchange info later and take care of it tomorrow, let's worry about the wedding first. She really was just fantastic all around.

Advice...

* Get a day of coordinator if you can. It is SO much easier than taking care of it yourself/having a friend or family member do it. We paid $500 for a DoC to setup/break down everything and she really made the day go smoothly and kept us on top of everything.

* Make as detailed of a timeline as possible. It was a little stressful coordinating who was leaving the hotel with who to the venue, etc. Also my husband had to pick a lot of people up at the airport, so maybe pay a friend from your area to be a designated taxi. It was different with us since 90% of our guests were out of town.

POST: So my gf (let's call her Amy) and I have been dating for over 3 years. We've gone through a lot of things together, good and bad. She was my first kiss, first gf, and I lost my virginity to her. We have had many talks about the future and getting married to each other. 

We regularly hang out with the same group of friends in and out of school. It consists of roughly 10 people. Around 3 of them are guys. The thing is we are all very close and hang out pretty much all the time. I've been getting very close to one of the girls in the group (let's call her Nancy). I was friends with her before I started dating Amy. Recently, I've gotten very close to Nancy. I've told her many things that I wouldn't even tell Amy. Some people have accused us up of ""flirting"" and have told Amy, who easily gets upset. Now, I'm a friendly person to begin with. I'm fine with making contact with all of my friends and I mess around with all of them, so I don't think of it as flirting. 

This has put me under a lot of pressure recently though. Since our group is mainly girls, I talk to girls pretty much everyday. But I feel like I have to act differently due to my gf. I feel like I can't laugh as much or talk as much, so Amy won't get jealous. 

Nancy trusts me and I trust her. We're pretty much best friends. But I think I might be developing a crush on her. 

I've started to care for Amy a little less, but I'm pretty sure I still love her. Breaking up with her would also be very awkward because we hang around the same group of people and our class is very small (97). Thank you.

Here's the thing: I've always, always thought for the last year and a half that I will finally be completely healed once I can tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. He only told me that he went to the library with her once, so he thinks I just reacted in a crazy strong way over that. I need to say to him: Look, I reacted so strongly because I was reading the texts between you and her, you and our mutual friend, and you and your sister. I saw all the shit you talked about me and I thought that you hated me which made me want to hate you. I need to say something like that to him now to finally put this all behind me but I don't know how to say it without making myself seem insane and like I'm still living in the past. I need advice on this desperately please help.

TITLE: Me [24, M] with my girlfriend[23, F] have been together long distance almost a year, needing advice on long term plan.
POST: My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but it's been entirely long distance (9 hours apart) with us taking turns seeing each other on weekends twice a month, and spending a week together on a couple occasions. 

My girlfriend was job hunting at the beginning of this past summer when there were two jobs opening up. One about 20 minutes from my house, another an hour further north of where she had been living. The job that was further away gave her $10K more a year than what she would've made living by me. I had no problem encouraging  this path because we had only been together a few months at that time, and wouldn't want her throwing her future away for me. 

Due to some unfortunate circumstances (my dad being in the hospital, her having to work multiple hours of overtime, a couple deaths in her family, etc.) we haven't been able to see each other this month and during the holidays. She told me a few weeks ago that she felt bad that she couldn't come home to me and felt lonely even though we can and do Skype, and basically that the distance is hurting her. I had already been thinking about moving up there, but was going to wait until the school year is over so I don't leave my employer in a sticky situation.

I'm a teacher at a private school, and even though my pay isn't awful, I'd be the one to make the move since it's an easier move for me. It also helps that I have friends that live in and around the same city she lives and works in. I want to offer to move up there, but don't know how to bring it up to her as we've been somewhat distant with everything going on.

TITLE: TIFU by contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source.
POST: So this happened a few weeks ago on my holiday to India. Back story: Indian toilets don't usually have toilet paper and are more often than not simply a hole in the ground that you squat over. I went to deposit a particularly nasty load of liquid shit or what the locals refer to as ""Delhi belly"". I'd also recently been given some very expensive glasses by my parents and was under pain of death not to lose them. So I was squatting down unleashing this never ending torrent of diarrhoea when my glasses dropped off my head and fell down the hole. In a state of blind panic and fear I shoved my hand into the bottomless pit of shit in an attempt to find my glasses and, after dipping my arm elbow-deep in shit, eventually discovered them and pulled them out. As they were covered in shit I didn't put them on and instead stumbled around outside half blind to find somewhere to wash them off, finding a small shack surrounded by what I assumed was a queue of people with a huge urn of water inside. Pushing through the crowd, I quickly rinsed my shit covered arm and glasses in this urn of cold water, returned the glasses to their rightful place and, feeling rather pleased with my lucky escape, strolled outside. I then realised my FU....the queue was full of people holding various jugs and cups and a sign on the shack read ""DRINKING WATER"" in bright red bold letters.

For one reason or another, my full time job ended up not having any work for me to do during the summer, so I decided to take a part time job. A statewide-famous sandwich shop in my state decided to open up a new store in my town, and I applied and was hired immediately. I started training last week, and we opened the store up for the first time this week.

Yesterday, while pulling a double covering for someone else, my boss informs me that I've been promoted, including a raise and further duties with closing the store and sending reports off to the franchise at the end of the night, etc. I'm pleased, since a promotion in a week seems like a good thing to me. Fast forward two hours, and my boss has a personal emergency. He pulls me into his office, explains the situation, and says, ""I hate to drop this all on you tonight, but I'm gonna need you to take over as manager. I figured it'd happen anyway, but wanted to give you more time to ease into it. You gonna be okay to do it?"" I accepted, and he left to handle his business, with me in charge of two teenagers who'd worked there just as long as I had.

I know it's hard to approach people at work, but the last thing I will do is creep outside the store until she heads home - HELL NO.

He recently moved back to our hometown, which gave us the opportunity to hang out this weekend over the holiday. Before I saw him in person we had started texting a bit. It was pretty harmless, but it is clear that he still as feelings for me. When we hung out this weekend it was a bit awkward. I'm not sure if that's because he's not as into me as he thought (I suspect he held onto strong feelings form HS that may or may not hold now) or maybe it was uncomfortable because he does still have feelings for me. Maybe it's something else...?

So now I'm unsure about how about to handle this. I'd like to continue talking to him, but I also don't want to give him false hope. If it's possible, how do I nurture a friendship without leading him on? Do I let him be the first to call or text? If he cares about me it seems shitty to never initiate contact, but then again this may make him feel false hope... Is this even possible?

I should also note a couple things. There is another female in his life, but she is in another state and they're not in a committed relationship.

I recently graduated from a specialized technical program and since graduating have had a ridiculous number of job offers and interview requests. I have actually turned down a number of interviews. 

I had a job lined up several months ago, but it was honestly not something I was very enthusiastic about, I only took the offer because they were the first to contact me and I was not sure what the job market in my field was like. We'll call then company A.

Long story short, I interviewed with another company last week, let's call them company B, and they exceeded all expectations and are basically a dream come true. They paid for my flight to their facility for the interview, put me up in a hotel and paid for a rental car. I had also previously turned in my notice with my current employer at the time, because company A, which I had already accepted an offer from, had expected me to start this coming week. I left the interview with company B feeling confident but without any offer in hand. Fast forward to today, I have notified company A that I won't be able to start with them and so am officially unemployed and awaiting some word from company B.

Am I insane to expect that company B is going to make some kind of offer? Should I be scrambling to find something solid? I have enough funds to keep me going for a few months if absolutely necessary.

To add some clarification, this is completely out of character for me, I have never left an employer without having a guaranteed job lined up already. I have no experience in this field but have a good amount of general management experience.

POST: There were approximately 15 people in the suite playing *water* pong and drinking a few beers, doing shots, playing music. All but 1 was underage. 

I was in my room doing work because I am a loser and have 3 tests on Monday to study for. 

The RA came in and said party's over and told them to dump the beer, wrote down everyones names, and told everyone who didn't live there to get out. 

She was REALLY nice about it and kept saying that we were all being really cooperative and polite and that would go on the report. 

There was a friend of ours who is an RA there who had just stopped by and got fucked by the timing. There was a girl who will probably get kicked off a sports team, and there was the guy who was 21 who could be in trouble for drinking with minors.
This is all of our first offense.

I talked to the RA personally and she said that if my roommates vouch for me not drinking and not being involved that will help my case, but I would probably get in trouble for just plain having knowledge of the party. But technically I never came out of the room for the one and a half hour that the party was going on for.

We're both used to sleeping on our stomachs or sides, but I'm finding it hard to find one position that works best. I hug things in my sleep, so spooning with him in the back doesn't really work unless I have an extra pillow, and we don't. However, when I'm in the back, I can't get my bottom arm under him without hurting his side (I have bony arms.) Us facing each other works for a bit, with him hugging me and me holding my arms between his and my chest, but he likes to surround me and I find myself running out of air. I can't think of any other position to sleep in except me lying on his chest, but last time we did that, we both got stomach aches. 

I'm hoping that this will help us out once he gets his own place and I start to spend the night there. If we're having troubles napping, I can only imagine how we're going to pull off sleep through the the whole night as well.

For example, I say ""Hey so and so, I love your hair, it looks really good"".

POST: Honestly, I'm not sure how significant this piece of information is in the context of our relationship.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a few months now, and he doesn't know that the drunken dance-floor makeout we had a little over a year ago, the first time we met, was my first kiss.

I've kissed plenty of other people since then, so it's not like he's the only person I've ever kissed. I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. 

Basically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.

Should I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my ""first"" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. 

I'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer. The topic of first kisses may come up at some point before then, though.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years, have different sleep patterns - says im selfish
POST: I've been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years and we recently bought our own house and moved in at Christmas.

I've always ran on about 6 - 7 hours sleep, and prior to moving in, I'd always do my own thing when I got home.  I'd play games, learn some code until I was tired which was usually until about half 12.  

My girlfriend is always tired and wakes up early for her job, she's usually up at 7 and out of the house by 8.  She goes to bed at 10:30 so gets about 8 - 9 hours sleep a night.

I've been trying to get into this sleep pattern, but I just find myself lying awake at night or being shattered the next day from too much sleep.

I'm wanting to spend some time playing some games, and with most people my age, the only time we get is later at night - hence the reason I was usually playing games from about 10 - 12:30.

Now we're living together, she complains that I either wake her up because she's a light sleeper, and how it's unfair for me to go to bed later because I should be thinking about her.

Personally I think this is wrong to simply demand this, but she's as stubborn as they come, and trying to talk sense into her just results in an argument.  I've tried explaining the above, or using the fact that when she wakes up in the morning, her alarm wakes me up, as does her getting dressed etc so I end up waking up an hour earlier due to her.  

I should add that I work from home in a stressful job, but she uses this as an excuse as to why I should respect her sleeping hours and go to bed at the same time (even if i lie awake for hours).  I can't go to bed later, I can't use my laptop in bed to code, yet she has to have the TV on to go to sleep to (I can't stand this)

I don't really know how else to tackle it, as everything gets turned into me being the bad guy and its all about her

A few days ago she ended things with me and I suppose I am writing this more to vent, since I was numb to the break up until today.

For a few weeks before I could tell she was pulling away. She said she felt pressured into being official, and was scared due to a very large amount of outside stress, mainly due to her grandmother being very sick in the hospital for months. About 2 weeks ago we had a large fight, where she was very iffy about making plans for a date and I was annoyed because she had been flakey about dates recently. We talked a few days ago and she said that she had intended to give it time and see where it went but after that fight she suddenly lost feelings.

Being honest, I am devastated. I had fallen hard for this girl and the idea that I had pressured her into things and caused her to lose feelings is a tough pill to swallow. That being said, I doubt there is much I can do to ""fix"" things and try again, and she is so guilty about hurting me I doubt she would even tell me if she did still have feelings or redeveloped them.

TITLE: TIFU by letting my 7 year old sister crash her friend's go kart into his dad's porsche.
POST: I'll start off by giving you a little background.  I am 16, and my little sister is 7.  She was bored and wanted to go hang out at her friend's house down the street.  So I took her there.

When we got there, her friend insisted on showing me his new go kart. So I said sure.  We went to his garage, and he showed me his go kart.  I asked if I can try it out and he said sure. I rode it around for about a minute and then got off.

Then my sister asked if she can try it. I was skeptical at first because she's never driven anything like this.  But then I thought, *""It has four wheels. It's not like she's gonna flip it or anything.""*

So I told her she can. I showed her all the controls. How to steer, how to go, and how to brake. Then I step away and let her go.

She then proceeded to drive straight into a Porsche. Her friend's dad's Porsche.  Everyone freaked out, and ran inside to tell him.  And to make matters worse, they exaggerated a lot and told him the scratch was ***huge*** and she was going ***super fast*** when she crashed into it.

The dad was super nice about it, but I felt guilty as fuck. I said sorry multiple times. And I told my sister to apologize but she never did.

Then about 20 minutes later as we were leaving, I told my sister to go say thank you for all the snacks they gave her and for being so cool about everything.  But instead of saying thank you, she started crying because she didn't want to go. The crying then turned into screaming and yelling and calling me names.  I finally had to carry her out of there because she refused to leave.  I kept on apologizing as we were leaving.

I've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life.

TITLE: GF of 5 years probably moving away, wants me to go but I said no.
POST: A little bit of history: I'm 23/m she's 22/f and we have been together on and off for 5-6 years now. This girl is my best friend and I will probably always love her no matter how things end up. She graduates from school in a few months and has this really great chance for a 1yr + internship in Boston, NY, or NJ (we currently live on the western part of the country) and may end up staying out of state beyond the 1yr if she finds a grad school she likes out there. Now the hard thing is that she wants me to move with her to where ever she ends up going and I flat out told her I wasn't comfortable with that **at all!** I don't even feel comfortable with moving in with her right now let alone leaving everything else behind to move across the country. I told her to go if she gets the opportunity because I'll be damned if I'm the thing to hold her back. The hard part about this is that we already tried the long distance thing at the beginning of her schooling 4 years ago and ended up breaking up for the first year that she was gone. She wants to go and would be willing to try the long distance thing again and keeps asking about my thoughts on doing LDR again. She also wants to try even though she seem hopeful it would work based on past experience and quite frankly I don't even want to try a LDR again (horrible shit). Every time she brings it up she basically leaves the decision on me about what we are going to do and I don't know what to do Reddit. Every time I think about it, something in me can't help but start counting down to the (final) end of our relationship even though I don't want it to end. Any advice? (sorry for the giant wall of text) and I will be happy to clarify anything if need be. Thanks in advance.

TITLE: TIFU and flooded my bathroom
POST: This happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the mood for a hot, foamy bath. I go into the bathroom, hop into the tub, add some bath salts (and no, I'm not craving for human flesh) and some of that thing that produces foam (I'm not English, sorry!) and lay on my back, eyes closed.

I should mention by now that our drain plug is chipped and lets water leak from the tub into the drain, so I usually take it out and put a plastic bag. It worked like a charm. Until today.

After 2-3 minutes, I hear bubbles in the secondary drain (the one on the floor made to prevent floods. Ironic, huh?) and realize that the water was at half the original level.

No biggie. I reach for the plastic bag to adjust it and realize that it'a gone. I look to the bathroom floor only to see it entirely flooded. The plastic bag was sucked into the drain and clogged it. By now, the tub was empty. I jumped out and ran to grab some towels. To my relief, the bag was flushed down and the water started going down the drain.

But I didn't finish bathing. And guess what? No hot water left. After a manly cold bath, I get out, dry myself and prepare for the worst. 

My house has a pretty weird structure. It's made by two buildings. One hosts the bedrooms and living-room, and the other hosts the kitchen and bathroom. They are connected, but there is no door between. From one to the other is a 10 meter walk. And I had to walk slowly since the ground was frozen, and it was cold as fuck outside. 

Now you may be wondering why I bathed in cold water instead of showering tomorrow morning. It's because my overly-protective parents forbid me from bathing/showering immediately before going out to prevent me from catching a cold.
TL;DR: ",Tried to seal bath tub drain with a plastic bag which got sucked in and flooded the bathroom. Had to take a cold bath and a walk through the yard.

TITLE: Reddit, BT is trying to charge my family £140 because the phone+hub they have given to us has failed. it has never worked from the day we have had it, and we pay line rental fee's for the phone but can't use it.
POST: BT provided us with a ""homehub"" (router) which has a built in phone. The phone has never worked, and yet we can only use that phone to get the 'free' calls that we pay for. Because it doesn't work it means we have to use a second phone, which means we receive very high charges.

My father called BT support up and asked them if they could repair it and, failing that, replace it, because the damage is nothing to do with us, and any and all filters on the phone have been checked and replaced, yet still nothing. They said ""we will repair the phone happily, just pay us £140 and we will send out an engineer""

Obviously we don't want this, we would rather just have a new hub, i mean it has to be cheaper for both sides for them to just replace it? it must cost them what, £40 to produce?

anyway, down to the point, they aren't budging, is there anything anyone could suggest we do to make the robbing bastards give us what we pay (heavily) for?

We'll start off with my morning. I wake up late for work. Had to be at work for 0730, woke up at 0710. I work for an ambulance service as an EMT and I am currently in paramedic school doing clinicals every other day I'm not working a 24 hour shifts on the boo boo bus. So I'm rushing around trying to get my uniform together when I fell a dart brewing. Ok seems innocent enough. No. It was a bubble of doom. I knew instantly as it was coming out that it was too late and I had just destroyed a nice fresh pair of boxers. So the boxers get thrown away and now I'm wasting even more time sitting on the toilet. My bowels are doing back flips and now I'm even more late for work. So I finish as fast I could then frantically find a new pair boxers and finish getting my shit together and get out the door for a 20 min drive to work. 

When I get to work I remembered I keep a bottle of pepto bismol in my box. Thinking it would help settle my stomachs and colon I decide to take some. Well that was possibly the worst idea I could of had st the time. Someone had decided to play a joke on me and put hot sauce in my medicine. Instant burning all the way down. My stomach is now doing front flips and back flips and side flips and any other flip you could possible image. Now I need to vomit. Made it in time to the bathroom luckily. That pepto was the only thing I had in my stomach and it felt like I was spewing hell fire. Now I like some spice here and there but this was hot hot. Not a flavor hot. So now I feel even worse and I just started my 24 hour shift. Yay.

TITLE: Drama with my BF's roommates
POST: My boyfriend lives with four other guys, one of whom he shares a room, Max. A few days ago, we got into a heated argument that almost resulted in us breaking up. We didn't because most of the issues we have  are because of Max, a 22 year old stoner who spends the majority of his day playing video games. Max does not have a job, go to class, and lives off of his parents money, most of which goes to weed and eating out. Because of Max's influence, my boyfriend has started gaming and smoking more. At Max's request, I've stopped coming over as much and doing certain things that bother him, such as coming in from the backdoor, knocking on the window to have someone unlock the door, bringing over extra changes of clothes, etc. All of these requests are reasonable enough but they have brought stress onto my relationship nonetheless. Other than that, we get along OK.

While my boyfriend and I were fighting, I called Max ""a useless piece of shit."" It was unnecessary and I certainly regret it, but it was honest. However, though we were outside, one of my boyfriend's other roommates overheard when he came to smoke a cigarette and told Max what I said. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but obviously that's what he would like me to do.

So here's my issue: I don't mind apologizing to Max but I feel like the informant roommate shouldn't have said anything to Max in the first place. My words weren't meant for other people and the other roommate knows that Max and I get along for the most part. Do I have a right to be angry at the other roommate?

TITLE: I (22 M) like everything about this woman (23 F) but her weight.
POST: Backstory: I'm originally from Maryland, but I just came back from doing a summer internship in Boston. In late July, I met this woman from OKC.. we were sexting pics within a couple days of first contact and at first I thought all this was going to be was a hookup because of the way things started. When I first saw her in real life she ended up being a lot bigger than I anticipated and I quickly noted that she was not my ideal body type but I still enjoyed the sex.

After sex, we just laid on my bed and talked for about 3-4 hours. We found that we had a lot in common and I realized that I actually enjoyed her company. She even bought me Chipotle afterwards. We decided we wanted to keep seeing each other, even though we both knew that I had to go back home to Maryland soon to finish up my last year of school. 

Fast forward to last week (Aug 24), she ends up coming down to visit me for the week at my parents' place in Maryland (where I'm staying for the next 2 semesters). She's met my parents and sister.

Basically, I find that I really enjoy her company, her personality, the way she supports me in my hobbies/aspirations.. everything except her body type. We have TONS of sex (2-3 times a day) but one time I couldn't finish and she asked if I thought she was unattractive and honestly I don't really find her body attractive but I think she has a gorgeous face. Of course I didn't tell her this I just said that I think she is beautiful. 

I like everything about this woman except her weight. She is about 5'6 and 155 and I am that same weight but I am 5'9. Sometimes I feel like I'm settling in the looks department (is this shallow?) because up until this point in my life I've only dated skinny/athletic women. Am I just scared about what my friends will think about her weight? 

I don't want to just cut her off since I really do like her but her weight bothers me slightly. What should I do?

TITLE: Looking for a Good Cat Feeder/Toy
POST: Hey everyone!  I need some help.  Me and my girlfriend have two cats who have gotten a little food obsessed.  They were both kinda fat at one point so we, with the advice of our vet, put them on a diet of organic wet food (we use Prowl, the dehydrated stuff that you add water to).

Well, they're getting a little obnoxious now.  We used to keep their food on top of the fridge, but once they went on a diet they figured out how to climb up on top of the fridge, knocked the box over and ate like a half a box of dehydrated cat food.  So, we moved it to our laundry room, on top of the washer/dryer combo.  If we ever left the door cracked they were up there again, tearing into the box.  The final straw came this weekend when we had left the door closed but they got it anyway!  How you ask?  Well we live in a loft, and they actually climbed on top of the bathroom (there's like four feet between the bathroom ceiling and the loft ceiling) found their way in the laundry room through the roof of the closet and tore open the box of food.

I think partly they need something to do!  We both work a lot and I take care of my grandma on the weekends so they're home alone a lot.  I want one of those toys that you can put treats in and they have to play with it to get them out.  I've tried Kong stuff, and while they love to play with the ""snowman ball"" they don't seem interested in/able to get out food I put in it (it came with some kind of salmon paste).  I need a good toy that will let a little food out at a time to keep their attention away from raiding the food box and keep them entertained while we're gone.  Anyone have something that works well for them?

Thanks in advance reddit!  :)

TITLE: having intense anxiety about possibly moving out, need advice
POST: Hello all,

So first of all thank you for reading this, now let's get into the meat of my dilemma

I'm currently going to college and my parents have graciously allowed me to live in their home while I'm going to college so I can save the maximum amount of money possible, for which I am very grateful. 

My father lost is Job about six months ago and has been vigorously looking for a new one. He recently has had two opportunities for employment come up. the problem is that one is in the middle of nowhere in the state we live in. They have invited me to go with them to which I have declined; I would like to stay in my current city and finish my degree. 

my anxiety has been running haywire.

logically I make enough money to live with a roommate, pay all of my bills, have extra fun money, and STILL save money. 

but my mind has been wracking itself with self deprecating thoughts and its honestly annoying. I was in the army and I managed just fine, so its not like I haven't been on my own before. I really don't know where this is coming from.  

I'll honestly be fine no what. I would honestly enjoy the option where my parents stay and I keep wracking up savings but I'm also fine with the other option as well, but my mind keeps telling me otherwise.

so I need your advice. How do I quell these thoughts of doom?

TITLE: My [35f] ex [34m] is physically abusing his girlfriend [30somethingF]. Should I talk to her?
POST: My ex and I were together for six years, which culminated with him holding a gun to my head threatening to murder me while he was under the influence of a drug (MXE). He has a lot of mental health problems and the drug abuse certainly does not help. 

Since the end of our relationship three+ years ago, he's been in a relationship with one woman and told me that he had gotten clean, which I've since learned is a lie. We have very little contact. Last weekend a mutual friend was with the ex and his gf and he was intoxicated and choked his gf in front of other people. The gf said it's happened a number of times. The next morning when everyone was sober, the gf tried to brush it off and act like everything was fine. She lives with him with her two young children. He still has guns. I'm absolutely terrified for her. 

On one hand, it isn't any of my business. My life changed substantially for the better after getting out of the relationship with my ex and I don't want to involve myself in any drama. I dropped him and everyone associated with him (other than this one mutual friend) back then because of how messed up I was after the gun incident. On the other, I feel like I should tell her about what happened to me so that she knows exactly who she's dealing with (although she may already know). His behavior is clearly escalating, he has guns, and he's still abusing this drug. My current boyfriend, whose opinion I value immensely, says that I should leave it be, but he is obviously biased.

I can't look at this situation objectively. What, if anything, should I do?

POST: Need some perspective! 

I've been in 2 long-term relationships since high school, so I've never really done the adult dating thing. I recently got out of my last one in the summer, and started casually dating in the fall. I've been having a lot of fun going on dates. For a while it was a string of first-dates and nothing serious, but recently I've been seeing a guy for a month and it's been going really well.

I enjoy spending time with him including going for dinners as we both are foodies, cooking dinner at his place, going out to the bar with his friends, that kind of thing. This past weekend he was acting off-standish and today he said that it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay. I mean I've paid for coffees and movie tickets and a few ones offs but when I thought about, I never did the whole fumbling-with-my-wallet thing very much. He would usually pick it up, but didn't say much after that. We talked it over and I told him of course I would pay for my share from now on. I wasn't even aware of it - I guess in my eyes, we weren't exclusive and if he wanted me to pick up my tab, he would have asked for separate bills or something to the tune of, ""Let's split it."" I would have been more than happy to - I'm not going out with him for the free ride.

I wanted to get some perspective from outsiders: is there a timeline when the girl should start paying? Is it right away, or after a month? Or totally depends on the guy?

POST: Throwaway account just in case.

Short story and context:

Girlfriend is here on a working holiday visa that was recently renewed. To renew said visa we had to call in a favor from a friend. Girlfriend being the trusting type she is told people she was close to including roommate (who up until recently was our friend) about the details of this process.

Situation in the house has been gradually deteriorating for a number of weeks due to silly reasons. Finally we decided to leave and look for our own place. Girlfriends birthday is coming up soon and I decided id like to throw a birthday party for her before leaving. Roommate was totally opposed to the situation, saying there was no day over the next 2 weeks this would be permissible because he had work and other plans blah blah blah. Situation escalated when he started aggressively demanding his way and I called him a tyrant. 

He threatened that if we even so much as have a single person over without his permission he'll go to immigration and try have her deported.

Unfortunately he's a bitter enough prick that I think this is a credible threat. My situation now is this: we have 2 weeks left till we move out, how can I fuck with him as much as possible and make him pay for being a vindictive asshole without him actually carrying out his threat.

POST: So I (M23) had been dating her (F21) for two years. Recently, she had become immature and rude to me. She then went back to the US for Christmas break and days before she returned, she said she had to tell me something. She got back and said she went to a party, got black out drunk and was taken advantage of. I believe my ex 100%, but I feel this was just something extra she did to push her over the edge, to give her that excuse to say what she ultimately wanted which was to break up with me. Her rudeness and immaturity that had ""developed"" wasn't enough to push me away so that I would do the break up, so I guess I interpret this event of her getting taken advantage of as her excuse so that she could do it. When she told me this, I realised she was PARTLY the victim here and was turning to forgive her. But then I asked her if she still loved me and she said she didn't know. She said her views on what love were had changed, she didn't think it existed anymore and she felt she had completely changed. She said she had to find herself, go travelling, see the world and get some perspective. She comes from a very messed up family and suffers with anxiety issues so I understand that she needs to figure that out before she can be with someone. But I am not just losing my girlfriend, I am losing my best friend too and I do not want to lose both.

I wanted to start a legitimate conversation about how coders view project managers and why they have those views. I am coming to the end of my senior year and I begin grad school in August where my focus will be in project management within the information technology realm. 

I myself have some background in coding (Java, Javascript, C, C#, VB .NET, some HTML / ASP .NET, SQL / MySQL) but not enough interest, drive, or skill to go out and do what you all do. I feel I have always been more of a people driven worker, and my passion for technology has helped me to decide to stay involved with it; this is why I landed in the world of Project Management. However, it disturbs me to see how many members of project teams despise their managers. 

I am asking you all this because I am finally able to start putting work in to really accelerate my learning in this sector, and one of the things I strongly believe in is getting information from the source. So I'm ask you all now;

TITLE: OK PEOPLE LISTEN UP! What do you believe Beauty to be? How do you define Beauty?
POST: Ok people listen up! I am doing a survey about what people perceive beauty to be. So here's the bottom line post a discussion so that I may reap the benefits and generate a discussion. 

next, you either PM me or comment. If you can send me a picture/ preferably send me a picture of what you believe beauty to be. anonymously or not, upload a photo or not, do what you wish, as long as as it relates to this question: What do you think beauty is? Maybe it is a little much to ask but I would like to have honest answers. If you don't want to be honest that's fine, I like funny shit. 

Here is the kicker, I want you to define what beauty is to you. I don't mean what you think is beautiful but rather what you perceive to be the definition of beauty pertaining specifically to your own life. Please post pictures as that is the main purpose aside from the notion of generating discussion. 

you can also submit your photos and videos to the tumblr survey. Although I know how a lot of you feel about tumblr. For those interested it's as follows:

Why do I take each day for granted and not strive for greatness like you do? I used to think myself a perfectionist because I force myself to be discouraged when I am not perfect, but that isn't the point of having the goal of perfection. The point is to keep moving, to welcome the defeat and criticism and just move forward and up. That's why I was reminded of [this,] and I just wanted to thank you all.

TITLE: What the hell can I do?
POST: I teach art lessons to underprivileged youths at a nearby elementary school through an organization at my university. After only ever teaching in middle/upper class areas, working with these kids has been a very eye-opening experience. I'll cut to the chase though... Today was my last day working with this particular class of kids, and one table started talking about when they were afraid of their parents. Two girls admitted that their parents regularly belted them, with one also saying her dad whipped her with metal wire, too, and the other saying her dad pounded her hand with a brick. When I tried to tell them that it was wrong for their parents to hurt them and told them it's illegal, they disagreed and thought it wasn't illegal. Yet another started crying when she got a somewhat poor progress report she had to take home for her parents to sign, saying her dad was going to beat her like he usually did. A different girl also told me that her mom calls her a ""fat bitch"" and that her dad was deported and went to jail after trying to kill her mother.

I asked the graduate student who serves as supervisor of the other undergraduate mentors like me what, if anything, I should do. Her exact words were, ""If you didn't see bruises, you can't say shit."" In a sad way I agree, and I realize I also have no proof that these kids are telling the truth, although they seemed serious. But thinking about some man taking a brick to a 9 year-old girl just makes me sick.
So I thought I'd ask you, Reddit. What can or should I do? I need some peace of mind.

TITLE: I've lied to all of my friends and built a false image of myself for anyone I have ever met.
POST: I don't know when it started. I don't know why it started. Most people put on masks or armor when dealing with others. I have so many mask and so many sets of armor. I can't pretend to be a real person anymore. I can't pretend that people know and understand me anymore.

Let me try and give you some background.

I am an 18 year old senior that had a chance to go to MIT full ride. I'm reasonable intelligent, 5;10, lithe wiry musculature, 140 lbs. I play sports, I did martial arts, I took advanced placement classes and I was friends with everyone. I did not date because I kept telling myself there was no one I really liked. That is what helped bring this all to a head.

It's not that there wasn't a girl that I liked enough to date, it's that there wasn't a single person around me who I could open up to. Who I could explain that I was a fake. That I lied about my childhood to everyone. That I lied about my adolescence to everyone. I've had plenty of friends, if you can call them that. I've had flings with women, if you can call them flings. I've been the life of the party and the main actor in a spotlight.

I've never been me.

Moving on now to the internet, I've been browsing for about eight years now. I was the generic kiddo on the internet for the first four. I quickly grew tired and developed yet another false identity.

I was a 16 year old Asian girl that went to my school for years. Some of my friends still don't know mostly because we haven't talked in a while. I took on a maternal role for a forum, quickly becoming a therapist in a sense. People would come to me and ask me for life advice and other nonsense and I would lie to them about who and what I was and give them their idiotic advice. Some would come back with success stories. Others would come back for more advice.

I'm really just rambling now and have no clue where i wanted to take this.

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my parents [50s M/F]. Father is emotionally abusive to my mother-questions
POST: Sorry for wall of text.

This is an issue that has been ongoing for most of my life. My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother. Luckily it has never turned physical (AFAIK), but whenever I visit home, I hear my father scream at and berate my mother for every little thing. For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).

I'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him. Whenever I bring up this issue, she always tells me that he is working on his temper and has other good qualities. However, my mother consistently tells me that he wasn't like this when she married him and if she had known how he would turn out, she wouldn't have.

I've already told her that when I have children I will be extremely hesitant to leave them alone with my parents. Their relationship has affected my own views on relationships greatly. Beyond that, I'm not sure what I can do. Cut off all contact until she leaves him? Just continue to ignore it for the rest of my life? I have no idea what the protocol is for situations like this.

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being a passive bystander.

Summary of what he does: demeans her opinions and beliefs, always believes he is right, yells constantly, doesn't care about feelings, constantly makes threats.

TITLE: TIFU by falling in love with a lesbian
POST: This happened last summer at UConn. I live in Connecticut.

My bestfriend has a girlfriend, who has an apartment at UConn. I like to drink and got really drunk walking around after we tried to sneak into a bar without paying the upfront tab.

We tried to get in through the kitchen. It smelt like buffalo wings, I led the way.

Non-sequitur. 

We got kicked out almost immediately. Being my drunk self, I lost my friends and made new friends, which I believe were frat boys. 

Drunk dancing like the left shark in the Super Bowl and started talking to hot black girls. They say they have a lesbian friend. Drunk JJ only hears Barney Stinson(I love HIMYM) say ""Make a lesbian straight. Legen-dary."" 

Meet lesbian friend, hook up and dance, fall in drunken love with a girl who is cool. For the first time in my life, my hook up meant something. We talked and I actually liked this girl. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later to a random dorm. She's hooking up with another random dude. And another dude. 

She hooked up with 3 other dudes after me. I don't think she was a lesbian. 

Drunk JJ doesn't care. She jumps on my lap and starts kissing me again after these other dudes. I liked it till I get that I'm being played.

My heart was broken until I realized there's a lot of lesbians I can turn straight. 

After leaving this random dorm, I got attacked by a deer. A deer in the middle of UConn's campus jumped me. I ran away and lived to tell this story to reddit.

I was so lost and drunk my best friends girlfriend had to find me. In the meantime, I ran into a skunk who ran away from me. I believe it was because of the fake lesbian smell.

POST: There is a backstory behind this so let me give it to everyone straight. I'm 17 M never dated anyone before. I have made posts prior to this one based around my issues with being able to date.

My biggest issue is that once a girl peeks my interest I pursue her until she develops the same feelings. Once I understand she is interested too I sort of back off. A friend of mine called me a ""chaser"" which is what I feel I am.

Now I have this girl that I know, really sweet, really smart, talented, the whole thing. I found recently she has feelings for me and we talked a bit about it after I mentioned I was aware of them. 

When we talked I gave her the impression that I wanted to date her and that we should talk in person and hang out a big more to be dating. The only issue is my gut AGAIN like always is telling me I'm not interested even though I really want to be, I'm just not.

TITLE: Petty pool day destruction
POST: So yesterday my girlfriend and I were at a public pool trying to relax a little bit and maybe catch up on some reading. Unfortunately it started raining so we took shelter under a little poolside gondola that fitted two people. The two of us were sitting and talking and having a nice time when a tennis ball bounced over to us. I noticed a group of about five boys around the age of 12 looking at me so I assumed they had accidentally overthrown it and rolled the ball back to them. 

Two minutes passed and another ball flies up to me. Again I rolled it back. After the third ball I knew something was up and I started to watch as the boys would wait until we weren't looking and throw a ball at us and then run up and retrieve it. After multiple throws, one of the balls flew up and smacked my girlfriend right in the chest. I threw all of the tennis balls I collected over the fence and glared at the laughing kids. 

The lifeguard walked up to us with a smile and told us to let her know if they threw another ball because she would love to kick them out. She also mentioned that she had berated the kids. 

Two of the kids came up and gave us a meek apology but my petty revenge was already plotted. The kids had not thrown a ball after the lifeguard's talk but on our way out we stopped by her stand and told her how they threw more balls at us. My girlfriend and I watched triumphantly as their pool day came to a sudden close.

POST: I recently saw a commercial on TV for Dove soap. In the commercial a statistic came on the screen that stated, ""9 out of 10 women do not think they are beautiful""

My gf [28f] falls into the 9 out of 10 women who think that. 

She is blonde, blue eyes and petite. Has amazing curves in all the right places. Big breasts and a great ass. She exercises three times a week. Loves to dirt bike and shoot guns!  (I think her personality is just as beautiful as her body)

When we walk down the street,  almost every guy we walk past checks her out. She doesn't notice this. My guy friends have all let me know I'm pretty lucky to have found a girl as good looking as her. Her female friends are jealous of her body. Her bi friend has even expressed interest in having sex with her!

What I'm getting at here is that she is clearly beautiful to everyone but herself. :(

She recently has expressed the desire to get botox done on her forehead and between her eyebrows. Preventive measure she'll tell me. 

I don't disagree or think it a bad idea. I just feel like she's doing it for the wrong reason. That reason being that she feels like she's not pretty. 

She had a breast reduction in the last year. And recently started getting her eyelashes extended. I think this is relevant. 

What can I do? I tell her all the time she's beautiful. I'll send random texts, leave notes in her lunch, flowers. Everything I can to get her to accept she's pretty. 

I want her to feel pretty before she needs to change her entire body.

POST: So I've always had the ""traditional"" view on drugs I.e. all drugs are bad etc. When I met my friend, who smokes weed, I've attempted to open my mind somewhat about drugs. I don't have a problem with her smoking weed in fact I've tried it with her a few times.  
However, last night she told me that a few weeks ago she and a couple of friends did MDMA. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Because of my upbringing, I always thought MDMA will fuck you over big style, but after I did some research I felt a little better. I'm still uneasy though. She did say ""I probably wouldn't want to do it again, it was fun and all but ehh""  
Am I right to be concerned that she's going to have no qualms about trying even harder stuff I.e heroin, crack, meth?  
There's a certain uneasiness I feel in addition, which I can't quite pin down, I think it stems to the fact that my wonderful, awesome friend is trying things I'd never considered her doing, and that opens a new side to her I've never seen before. But thats my problem, not hers.

Cut to today, I've had 3 more hours of dog barking until they got home and then dancing with the stars cranked way up followed by what I think is Nancy Grace coverage of Furgeson and they won't even answer the door this time. I'm done at this point so I hooked up my laptop, maxed the TV and hit play on a 30 minute Nyan Cat loop. I'm ready to fight dirty. Up next is heavy metal from my high school days.

I have a free week after and am trying to figure out how I would best spend it. I realize it's not a lot of time, but I'd like to hear what you would do if you had an extra week.

I'll probably have seen enough of Spain (and a little bit of Portugal, probably) to be happy, so I'm thinking of traveling elsewhere in Europe. However, I'm a Brazilian citizen, which probably doesn't affect much, but it's worth considering if I have to cross borders. 

I don't expect to go backpacking/hiking/scuba-diving or anything like that in such a short amount of time, but I'd be very happy being a ""fish out of water."" I love beaches and mountains, really any scenery or cities would be cool with me. 

Basically, this would just be a good way for me to whet my appetite with a little bit of Europe. Probably I have enough time to explore maybe two cities or so counting travel, maybe see a good museum or two and eat some interesting food. 

If you have suggestions (anybody know anything about getting into the Paris tunnels?) about any thing that I just **need** to see/visit/eat/dance or something, I'd love to hear it.

POST: Throwaway account. I have never posted on Reddit ever so please be gentle on the formatting! I am trying my best.

I met Nick* on Tinder. I was just checking it out for fun, my best friend loved and used it etc. I met up with him and we just hung out. He's a nice guy and I just had broken up with my ex. So we became friends with benefits.

Since I left that summer for college, we just sext a lot. And often it was just texting but sometimes he would ask me for some pictures and I was naive  so I thought a 3 second picture on snapchat should get the job done and keep me safe.

Three months into this; snapchat notified me with the little triangle symbol that he had screenshoted it. And I **FLIPPED OUT**. I told him it made me uncomfortable and so the next time we met up, I had him deleted them off his computer. And I thought he understood that I didn't like the fact that he saved the pictures. He said he would stop. 

Recently, we met up and I asked him if he saved any of the pictures. And he said that he didn't. However, I saw on his phone that he had one of the apps that allows you to secretly screenshot snaps without letting the other person know.  

When he returned, I asked again. And he said maybe he saved a few and that he only did it because he really liked them and he saved them for fun. I begged him to delete the pictures and he said no. So I left. And he deleted me off snapchat. 

This guy that I trusted, has nudes of me. I am terrified and I understand I should never ever taken them in the first place. But I never thought he would be this kind of person. He was so sweet in the beginning. I fear he'll share them and ruin my career. I had a nightmare last night that he had cameras in his bedroom and that he has videos too. I don't know what to do anymore.

POST: I graduated college with no debt 5 years ago (majored in English Literature, mistake number one), then threw that all in the garbage by taking out a large student loan to start a graduate program I subsequently quit.

I have been working whatever part-time jobs come my way since then. I promised myself that if I ever go back to school, I would save up my money first and pay my own way because I felt so stupid about being in debt with this loan for no reason.

But I have recently decided what I want to do with my life. I want to go back to school to get started on this path, but my current job pays less than 10 dollars an hour and I can't imagine how long it would take to save up enough money to really get started.

Should I go ahead and take out loans to finance my education now that I know what I want to do? Or is my guilt and hesitancy about debt rational? I know I'm miserable right now, but nothing is guaranteed and I feel like I may just be setting myself up for more misery and even deeper debt down the road if I still can't find a decent job later on (I want to go back to school to become a teacher and I know sometimes it's difficult for new teachers to find work).

This time he told me that he had liked her, months later we started to try and rekindle things and then I saw him talking to her again, but he claimed he was fighting with her because she was talking to a kid he did not like. I asked him why he cared so much, and he said it was because she was his friend and he despises the kid. Which I know it total bullshit, but yet we were still trying to work on things. After months have passed, we still are trying until he started hanging out at her house, and she has been attending parties at his with her boyfriend and all because they all have mutual friends. He will talk to her, and continue to hang with her and friends. This is all no problem since we are technically not together.

As of recently, I have just been feeling really not myself. I have good days and I have bad days where I feel really low. On the good days I'm convinced that I'm just being weird and that it will pass. On bad days I feel really negative and agitated.

As of recently the low days are outnumbering the good days. I feel very irritable and I feel so bad for how my bf has to deal with it. I sometimes don't feel like being touched. He is so loving and just wants to be near me and snuggle all the time but it just makes me push him away and get agitated. The more I push the more he tries to fix it and by being more loving.

I have zero sex drive and I end up declining his advances because I never feel up to it. We talked last night and he said he feels like I don't care about him as much anymore. That broke my heart because i feel absolutely terrible with how I have been treating him.. being distant and not wanting to have sex. And I know he has to feel that way based off of how I act but I am having a hard time dictating how I feel and why.

I don't think it is the relationship unless I just don't like being smothered with attention but it feels more than that. I quit my recent job because it was too emotionally draining and I feel like I want something but I just can't put my finger on what.

Even though she is one of my best friends and I tell her to stop doing these things but she goes on how I'm being a too much of a ""goody goody"" in her words, I no longer want to be associated with this type of person, but I cannot help my self to break contact with her since I see her everyday at school, we talk almost everyday, she lives near me, and she is the closest I ever had to a girlfriend.

She is a very charitable person and is always looking into volunteering and donating. At first I was thinking of donating to a charity/organization of her choice, but I decided that I actually want to do something instead (or maybe along with donating). I have access to a 3D printer that my buddy owns so I was thinking of making something using that. However there are a couple of problems which is why I am making my plea to you redditors!

1) I have no artistic capabilities and can not graphically design anything. Thus it must be something that already exists (for example things from thingiverse.com) (Or if one of you amazing redditors can make me something that would be beyond amazing!)

2) I want it to be thoughtful and a tiny bit cheesy, but something that tailors to her charitable, nice, intelligent traits.

3) I have about 20 days to make and paint whatever object I decide upon.

Here are a few ideas I saw on thingiverse.com that caught my eye:
[Heart and Key](

[Nice Bracelet](

[Twisty Bracelet](

I looked around for a good subreddit for this and I feel like this is somewhat of a thought-provoking question, hence why I posted it here.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my close friend [31 F] became intimate but now things are awkward.
POST: So I have been in a serious long term relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend and by serious I mean I am thinking about proposing within the next year.  However, about 2 years ago I met a really amazing girl, lets call her C.  C and I have been getting closer - we text regularly, are able to make fun of each other like I do with my bros, and we usually go out for drinks at least once a week (i let my gf know this of course).  We really connect as we have the same career (finance) and she is one of the more interesting individuals i have ever met and understands me (very few people do as I think I am quite complicated).  Anyways, the other night we went out for drinks and ended up at her place.  We had a few more drinks and we end up making out - this was one of the most passionate make-out sessions I've had in a long time.  The next morning, we sober up a bit and now things are a bit awkward and I feel like shit for cheating.  She says to me that if I have no intention of being with her, its best that we don't see each other anymore. She's out of town for the weekend as she has family matters to attend to and we will talk when she's back.  

I know this is selfish but I don't want to lose C as a friend and also don't want to break up with my current gf.  I'm aware that it's not fair to C but it feels like my best friend just suddenly died.  I'm not sure which direction to go ie 

1) break up, date C

2) Never talk or see C again

3) Do shit all and go with the flow

Any advice on what to say when I meet up with C or advice on what to do is appreciated, thanks.

TITLE: I (27 F) shed a lot of hair and my boyfriend (37 F) wants me to pick up every single one of them in the bathroom each time.
POST: If you ever lived with a girl before or you are one, you should know that girls shed a lot and their loose strands can be found pretty much anywhere in the house. 

Understandably, my boyfriend gets incredibly annoyed that he finds so many of them in our bathroom. So now, every time I'm in the bathroom, I always make sure to pick a bunch of my loose hair on the ground and then throw it away. I also brush my hair daily to make sure that I can catch the loose hair before they drop to the ground.

I don't manage to pick up each and every loose strand in the bathroom and that's what he finds unacceptable. The bathroom floor has to be completely free of my hair but the problem is I shed a lot and so often that I can't be spending all of my time cleaning up all my hairs.

Is he being unreasonable?

TITLE: Hey, Reddit, I feel like I have a lot of repressed and most likely misplaced anger towards female gamers/nerds. People who may feel similar, do you consciously know why?
POST: Obviously, it can't be all that repressed if I'm making a thread about it right now. The anonymity helps me to speak about it more openly, I believe.

From that Nerdy Nummies chick on YouTube to pretty much 90% of the women I've raided with in WoW. Even the woman that I play with in league and know IRL irritate me greatly, even though I'd never admit it out loud.

The only motive I can think up that would make me so upset is that they are applauded for embracing their ""geekdom"" while most males are criticized. Which is pretty stupid since I like women and playing with them should be enjoyable. They tend to have pleasing voices and be more willing to play support roles(100% personal experience).
TL;DR: ",Please tell me why it's okay to be annoyed by women who play games so I can refrain from dealing with the fact I'm a misogynist neckbeard who's unsatisfied with his own manhood or something like that.

TITLE: I [29 M] don't think I'm falling in love with my [28 F] new gf, same as last time. Worried I've got a pattern
POST: Been seeing this girl for about a month, but we're not committed because I told her I'm not ready. She wants to be in a committed relationship. 

She's had enough experience to know she won't have sex until then, which is okay with me (though not how I usually do it). 

We have a lot in common: get along, have similar interests, etc. She's pretty cute and just finished grad school. I guess she fits the bill.

But I'm just not that excited about it. Lukewarm.

Back in January I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months for the same reason, and a year ago I did the same with a girl of 2 months. All 3 girls wanted to keep dating me. 

There have been a few girls I've been excited about after a date or two, but they weren't that into me.

I'm afraid I'm victim to the old Groucho Marx quote, ""I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.""

These girls are catches and I'm beating myself up for not being that into them.

Maybe this is normal and just called dating. Should I break up with current girl right now? 

Do I just need to be patient and wait for feelings to build? That didn't work last time.

Should I just be patient and hold out until a girl knocks my socks off? I think I've really gotta ""fall"" for them. But maybe my standards are too high.
TL;DR: ","This great girl really likes me but I don't think I'm falling in love with her, same as happened in previous relationships. Is this is a neurosis, a pattern & practice, or just normal?"

TITLE: My [24M] gf [20F] sent me a really cryptic message about something she wants to talk about, but won't talk right now
POST: I'm currently long distance with my gf for about two months since she's interning elsewhere. Last Friday I went to a workshop in another city (and am still here), and I noticed she just ceased all communication over the weekend. I sent her some messages asking what's going on, and she finally responded last night with the following sequence of messages.

her: Ill talk to u when u get back from dc

me: huh why

her: I have something i want to talk to u about but not while youre there so ill wait for u to come back first

me: i can Skype you now

her: No, ill talk to u when youre back

me: why does it matter where I'm at

her: Oh, didnt see this
Ill just talk to u when u get back, i dont want to talk about it right now

me: you said that already

her: I dont have anything else to say atm

I'm going back home in two days (to my place, not where she's currently at), but I can't stop thinking about this today, and it's distracting me from other things. I don't really want to press her further if she's unwilling to talk, but on the other hand I need a better understanding of what's going on right now.. if someone can help me decipher the cryptic messages she sent, it would be much appreciated.

We've been apart for nearing two months now but I have a flight to visit her in a little under two weeks.

TITLE: Deep physical and emotional connection...but we don't want a relationship? Can someone explain?
POST: I (male, 26) have a very good friend (female, 25) that I've recently gotten much closer to. Over the past month and a half or so we've come to realize that we are able to communicate and understand each other on a deeper level than with anyone else. We are incredibly similar, in all of the ways that truly matter. We see each other usually a few times a week, and talk every day, for most of the day, including at night for several hours. 
We're also both physically attracted to one another, but she is just coming off of a breakup with a long term partner, and I am recently divorced, so we don't want to do anything with one another right now. But the desire is there.

The thing is, though, that we both agree...we don't feel like we want to be in a romantic relationship with one another. We don't want to ""date"". It seems...weird to us. 

So my question is, what is this relationship? If we get along so well, have such a profound connection, spend so much time together, and are physically attracted to each other, why do we not feel like we want to date each other?

TITLE: I[18F] do not know what to do with my boyfriend[20M] of a year and a half , with him going away for school.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. And everything is perfectly fine. We have a great relationship with no problems, never broke up. We're really happy!  

He's a junior in college and I'm a freshman in college, I commute to a local university and he went away to school then came back  commuted to a community college for a year and now he recently got into a university where he has to go away again. We talked about it and I was really upset but I understand it's what he has to do. 

It's not even distance will be the problem, it's not that far away at all, Problem is, is that he's never been single going in college and wants to try it out. He's been in relationships starting from like his sophomore year of high school. He dated a girl for 6 months, then dated a girl for 2 years, and then met me right after and we instantly clicked. But on the other hand he said really loves being with me and what we have is really good! 

He doesn't know what to do. I do not know what to do.  He knows if he breaks up with me it will probably never be the same and that he will miss me, but he's telling me that he's so unsure it's eating him up. He said he kind of wants to realize he needs me by being away but I really want to stay together and see how it works out and then decide. He leaves in a week. What do you guys think we should do? Anyone have any similar stories or went through the same thing? Opinions?

POST: We're known each other from the internet for 7 years, exchanged pics, talked a lot in the past on the internet, liked each other a lot, but in the last 2 years, none of us kept in touch. 

We work in different cities, 6-7 hours car distance. 

A few months ago, my job offered me the opportunity to work in his city, for 5 months. One week before I left, I contacted him and asked him out; he didn't know I was there. He accepted and we stayed like 6 hours to talk without any sexual or romantic topic. 

At the end of the ""date"" he asked me when I'm coming back and he said that ""now you have my number, you can call me at any time"". And I told him that maybe we will see each other again and he said ""of course we will"" and that's it, he hadn't contacted me since and I don't know if I shoud do it, but I dont wanna push things... 

Now a little of myself: I'm recently out of a 5 year relationship and planned to relocate in that city and I feel stuck with this guy in my mind, because he is as I always known him: smart, interesting, people person, handsome etc. 

The relocation means professional oportunities for me, but I'm not sure my boss will let me go and lately I also consider relocation for this guy but when I try to conclude things, I get extremely confused because I'm not sure he likes me more than an old internet buddy

TITLE: I [24M] am afraid to become over-attached to [22F]
POST: We have dated for 5 month now and she is my official GF for 1,5month and I am afraid I might get over-attached and that I am turning into someone I do not want to be. One example, an old-highschool friend visited her and they went out partying (I went somewhere else) and he spent the night at her place (we dont live together and he doesnt live close). I am totally okay with that and I know that since she only has one huge bed and no couch that he slept in one bed with her. I trust her and I know that she would never cheat on me but still I become paranoid. She accidentally called me by his name today (and she was so embarrassed and sorry) and that freaked me the fuck out. I know that she loves me a lot and she told me that she never felt that much in love before and I believe her. Why do I still become paranoid? I couldnt sleep tonight because I was creating scenarios in my head in which she cheated on me or something else bad happened.

Do I have self-esteem issues or something?

I am someone who needs a lot of freedom in relationships. If I wanted to visit a female friend and platonically spend the night and I couldn't because my GF wouldnt let me, I would be so annoyed, so it seems just natural to me to give her the same freedom I am expecting of her but why can't I just be cooler about this? It feels like my emotional shields protecting me from my own paranoia are completely shut down. It feels a little like I am tripping out on MDMA or something.

TITLE: Mediocre problem with my ""girlfriend"" or whatever you may call it.
POST: So.. this seems like a very mediocre problem but it has been bothering me for the longest time.

1. We've been together for about four months. 
2. She isn't my girlfriend. She says she doesn't like the title of being a girlfriend and that her first boyfriend was awful. So she was only ""dating"" the previous ""boyfriends"" she has had. (So technically she has only had 1 boyfriend and the other guys were just relationships)
3. She never has time or makes the time (She says she's incredibly busy). We probably hang out about every two weeks unless I push hard for some time to hang out. 
4. I don't know what else. She's someone I thought I would actually like and it kind of just happened. Before, she used to think I was this cool, super outgoing person (things she said before I had an interest in her) while she was this super shy girl (who actually seemed to waver on the social side). But now I'm interested in her in ways I never would've thought because of her personality and her drive and how different and unique she is to just about any other girl I have ever dated. 
5. I'm also afraid that maybe we moved too fast. Was sex on first date bad? Did it make it so it becomes hard to build a relationship since there was no tension building up on it?
6. She has never introduced me to anybody and shoos me out whenever she is expecting anybody. 
*I just want to build that she is the type that spent her life alone from middle school to high school. Would this be the reason she treats me so? 
7. Am I just a fuck buddy to her?

The real question I'm asking is whether she isn't making the time for me because she genuinely doesn't have an interest for me and I should end the relationship or make some kind of ultimatum. Or if it is because she really is busy and really doesn't expect much time out of our relationship but she actually does hold an interest. We also live only about 3 blocks away from each other.

TITLE: [25/m] Enamored of my best friend's sister [21/f]
POST: Using a throwaway just to be safe. Mostly.

I've known one of my friends for around 10 years, and though we no longer live near each other, I make an effort to spend time with her a few times a year. She's practically a sister to me. In that time I've become close to her family, including one of her sisters, let's call her Olivia.

Olivia may or may not have been fond of me for some time. In recent years, my friend sent me teasing texts like, ""When are you visiting again? Olivia misses you."" At the time, I liked Olivia as much as one likes any annoying-but-somehow-endearing younger sisters of your best friend, so I rolled my eyes and humored her. I figured it was a phase, and it probably was.

Well, as it happens, I hate myself; Olivia has grown on me. After teasing Olivia through her college years for being in a related discipline embroiled in a conflict with my own, she switched to my major. Funny, that. Having the ability to share in obtuse conversations certainly enabled us to spend more time together, and I find myself stupidly grinning at even the worst of her puns.

Fast forward to the present. Olivia and I are both graduating in the spring. Part of me knows that keeping my mouth shut is the safer course of action, and much of this could just be me projecting, but I still want to open up to my friend before we all part ways. I'm trying to conceive how best to broach the topic with her, as it's going to be awkward regardless. I know all the risks involved, and I even considered the cataclysmic scenario in which it's my friend and not her sister who has feelings for me, which is ridiculous, but you know what they say about truth and fiction.

I come home from work every day exhausted--not from the work but from being around my coworker for the whole day.

He talks too much, either about meaningless bullshit or really, really weird things for which there are no good responses. He complains all the time about who's not doing enough work or how others are doing their jobs, etc, no matter how many times I tell him to quit worrying about everyone else and just do his own work.

POST: What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?

Background:
My employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.

My problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. 

I calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as £530. I only earn £1,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.

Can I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?

My issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).

I think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary. New job would be a  £4,500 pay increase; walking distance so less fuel costs; less travel time etc.

We were rivals in a bunch of things at school, and it wasn't a problem, but had a big fight when I was rejected from my first-choice university after Harry also applied and got in with a very similar resume, even though he had no intention of going. We made up, and later he offered me a chance to join him in starting his business (part-time while studying), but I declined.

In hindsight, I think that not putting enough effort into university applications and not being willing to commit to the work associated with a start-up are two of the worst decisions I've made. I'm fairly high-achieving by most standards: have ended up at a top university anyway, getting good grades, currently working a well-paid internship, etc. Of course it's difficult not to be comparative, but by itself the fact that I'm jealous of Harry is something I think I can deal with. What's making it really problematic that his successes are closely correlated with my own biggest regrets. Since we're living in different countries right now, it takes some effort to Skype and stay in contact; but because of those associations and the emotional response I get when thinking about them, I'm increasingly hesitant to do so (he talks about his academic and corporate work a fair bit, since they're very big parts of his life right now), and have to focus on pushing down those feelings when we're talking. Of course this is my problem not his, and I'm not sure it's the sort of thing I'd want to discuss with him, but I'm wondering how people would recommend dealing with this.

POST: I'm starting a business (only local and online at first, no brick and mortar) and at first this will only be selling apparel. 

I have a name of the business, a name of the apparel line, and a logo. I've check trademarks and everything is fine - do I need to trademark the name before I sell anything? 

The trademark (I believe has to be done separate since the names are slightly different between company name and apparel line name) is expensive I think (700 up front maybe?) - didn't know without doing that if I had any protection if someone stole my name and or logo.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my Ex-Fiancee[27 F] 5 years, how long until it doesn't matter?
POST: Fairly new Redditor here, and a private person so posting something like this should show the level of lost I'm at...also sorry if format is wonky. 

Anyway, had a relationship with an awesome girl starting Jr year of college and extending through 3 years after graduation. A little bickering but no big fights and we got along really well 95% of the time. We had moved in together, both had stable jobs and were engaged to be married in 7 months time. (Had been engaged about a year at this point.)

One night she wakes me up 1-2 AM and simply says ""I'm done."" No clue or hints leading up to it, just two words, goes downstairs to sleep on the couch, and has packed essentials for a move to parents house while I am at work the next day. In 6 months she's married a new guy but claims all that happened ""after us."" Come to find out her parents resented me for... reasons (honestly never clear on the what or why) and basically had been telling her to do better for a few years. YEARS! 

So...it's two years later and I'm with a wonderful girl for almost a year now. Problem is I go into these funks where all I can think about is what I lost, what could I do different, etc. This sounds bad but probably 2-3 times a month I wake up and my first waking thought is crippling disappointment that she's not there next to me. I am 100% committed with my current girl, but deep deep down I don't know how I would feel if relationship prospects with the ex weren't 100% killed. How long (or how do I) get back to ""normal""? Any advice on ways to stop dreaming/imagining about the life we were planning?

Thank you fellow Redditors.

TITLE: Have lost all my motivation to go to work
POST: I recently switched jobs (5 months) from a larger institution to a smaller company. Over the last month I have gotten very disillusioned with my new job, I miss the camaraderie of my old job as well as the lower level of stress. Also the old job was much closer to my house.

For me the most important thing is not my job, I don't have the ambition to be in a super high paying job, I like having an average job if it means I have the energy and motivation to do that and extracurriculars.

I recently applied to a different job posting at my old company. I feel totally unmotivated to go to work and I've called in ""sick"" about 3-4 times the last month....

I guess what I'm asking is; how do I stay motivated to keep going to work right now, at least until I get another job, and should I just go back to my old boss and ask him for my old job back (as opposed to trying for this new position). He mentioned I could do that because he likes me.

POST: So first a little bit of backstory to put things into context: I recently started university and got along well with a girl. I subsequently asked her out for dinner to which she accepted. It wasn't explicitly mentioned that it was a date but I guess I assumed it was implied which probably was a bad idea. The ""date"" went extremely well and I did have a wonderful time with her and although I really do like her, I get the impression it's one sided.

During the date, I told her that I considered this a date and whatnot and well I feel like I've put my foot in my mouth. How do I now tell her that I don't really care what happens and I would rather keep her as a friend than be awkward around each other?

TITLE: [HELP] My girlfriend's dog isn't trained, and she refuses to let me train him...
POST: Her dog has been with her since it was 8 weeks old. He is always at her side and she spoils him.

He also has the bad habit of begging for food when we are eating because she gives him food from her plate. She believes dogs in nature just expect humans to share food with them and she is completely okay with letting him lick the plates and bowls clean ""if he didn't beg"". Which just means if he lays by her feet and stares at her, she will eventually give him food. How can I break this behavior?

He also doesn't use his dog bed to sleep in, instead he humps it. And she allows him to hump it. He humps sheets, pillows, anything and she doesn't scold him at all. I'm afraid to get a cat because he might start humping it.

Upon the front door opening he makes a break for it. He doesn't wait, doesn't hesitate. And just runs for it, which makes me afraid I might come home from work and he will run out and I'd have to chase him down.

He also barks randomly at random times even after being let out or played with. It's quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and he is barking up a storm and scratching the bed I'm sleeping on.

He sleeps on top of the couch and I try to make sure he stays off the furniture but according to her "" thats just what he does""

If he is on my bed or the couch he will also start trying to dig and I dont like him doing that to my sheets because he's a dog with nails and I don't want my sheets or couch ripped.

Every time I try to bring these issues up to her she tells me it's her dog, not to yell at him, don't push him down when he's jumping on things, etc.

How do I fix this situation? Or am I overreacting?

TITLE: I just found out my best friend self-harms. What do I do?
POST: A bit of background on her: seventeen, in high school (as well as myself). Straight-A student, probably going Ivy League. Quiet around most people, loud and hyperactive around me. Likes to read. Popular, but I've noticed she seems to crave attention a lot -- she's a self-described 'camwhore' with a 'god complex', and I've seen her do various 4chan tinychats with thirty or forty guys, even though she was [doxed] once. I don't ever say anything about it, as it's her business. She was also homeschooled as a kid -- didn't go to public school until age fourteen.

She has panic attacks and cuts typically when her parents tell her she's doing something wrong, whether it's minor or not. She says she 'doesn't like to think [she] does things wrong, just different' and she 'wants them to know she cares.' I know she cuts because she sent me a picture. I deleted it, even though I know now I really shouldn't have.

I also know I have to tell someone, but I don't know who. Her parents wouldn't believe me, and she's convinced that cutting is the only way to release pain, so she won't get herself help. Can I help her? If so, whom should I go to? I'm not sure the school counselors are of any use -- I've been through this a few times with different people and different issues, and they're very negligent in these sorts of matters.

So, me and Kit met at band camp, and quickly became friends, mostly because we both play clarinet. Apparently, she really liked me from the start. I liked her as well. Jump ahead about a month, and you find me and Kit at an after-game party. She soon asks ""Hey Jack? Would you like to be my boyfriend?"". And I reply ""who wouldn't, Kit?"". Soon, we are cuddling on a nearby bench.

Jump ahead about 2 weeks, and you'll find Kit slowly unzipping my pants(we are both needy on the sexual side). Soon enough, I get a good sucking. And a little later, she gets a good show of my finger tricks. Again, jump ahead a week or so, and you join us in an adventure:
""Hey, Jack?""
""Yeah?""
""Where's the quietest place we can go?""
""Follow me, my lovely Kit""
I lead her to the guest bedroom. She hops on the bed, and tells me to undo my pants. I do so, and then she follows. As I lean her back, I mention how sexy she is. It gets sweaty in that room for a few moments.

Skip ahead, again, 2 weeks, and you'll find me sucking her breasts. Again(for the laat time), skip ahead a few weeks, and you'll find us hardly talking to each other.

I'm gonna need help to get over this, guys.

TITLE: Found out my (28F) best friend (29F) of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post. At a loss for words.
POST: First, the goods news. She is no longer living with cancer!

This morning when I woke up and for some reason grabbed my phone and checked Facebook immediately. I rarely do this. This first post I see is from my best friend announcing that today is a good day because she is cancer free. I was in shock because I didn't even know she had cancer!

Clearly she has her reasons for not sharing this information with me, but I feel like an absolutely terrible friend that she felt she could not tell me. Furthermore, I have known a lot of people to get cancer in the past 7 years, and I always would tell her ""so and so has cancer and I'm really sad, hoping she/he will get better soon"" and if I'd known she also had cancer I wouldn't have brought it up so much!

A bit of background on our friendship and why I feel I've been an insufficient friend to her:
We met in elementary school and were bffs. During my second year of high school, I had to move so we stopped seeing each other as much. We still hung out when we could and she was always my best friend. At the end of high school I started dating a guy who turned out to be abusive. We were together for 5 years, and throughout that time period he slowly isolated me from my friends and family, and said mean things about the people closest to me. (Things like my parents didn't really love me and other fucked up things.)

Anyway, I got out of that relationship, so i started hanging out with her more again. It was a relief to me that she didn't completely hate me for my time spent being distant. For the past five years we've lived in different cities, but we still see each other once in a while and write letters to each other. (We've always sent each other snail mail)

I'm currently working on a reply to one of her letters, but I don't know how to approach this topic, since I found out through social media and not a personal message. I already feel terrible that I haven't even sent her a text.
TL;DR: ",My bff had cancer for years and I never knew. Feeling insecure and like a horrible friend. Not sure how to express to her how happy I am that she is OK.

TITLE: Me [23M] - cannot handle my friends [same age, M/F] hanging out with my parents
POST: Hi - kind of a weird question / situation. I'll try to be brief.

I am from country A, did high-school in country B, and am currently in the United States for college. My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.

The problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. 

I cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.

I remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.

So, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.

It's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.

POST: A large group of our friends are going to this weekend camping festival and due to the size of it and how we are all arriving on different days it is unlikely that I am sharing a tent with my girlfriend.

She recently suggested that we ""took a break"" for the festival. At first I was shocked and didn't know if it was because she didn't want to spend time with me, had stopped liking me and even wanting to go out getting with other boys.

I obviously said no and asked why she wanted that and she just said she trusted me however didn't trust my friends and thinks they would egg me on to get with other girls and fool around a bit.

I'm really confused about the whole situation, she says she was ""testing me"" to see if I would want to take a break however that feels like she doesn't trust me. Also I feel like maybe she doesn't like me as much as I thought seeing as she suggested we break up so I can fool around..

I'm really confused about this whole situation and just want some outsiders' opinions to sort of guide me through it.

So here is what's going on now. About a week ago, she took a break from her boyfriend. She came to my house and we fooled around for about 6 hours. It was amazing, but I feel like a horrible person for doing it. She says she loves me more than anything and wishes we were together, but she's too afraid to leave the position she's in now because it's ""too risky"". Now she's done with her break and she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I love her so much, I just don't know what to do anymore. I told her that it would be difficult being friends because at the end of the day, she'll be going home to her boyfriend and that's going to break my heart. Sorry guys, I feel like a total bitch looking for advice because I usually stray from this kind of drama that I somehow got sucked into. I just don't know what to do anymore.

POST: My boyfriend is a horrendously picky eater, both when we cook at home (most of the week) and when we go out (once or twice a week). He'll eat only white chicken meat, steak, pizza, spaghetti or a hamburger. Green beans are the only veggie he'll touch, and he has to be vigorously persuaded to eat any fruits, after which he expects to be praised as if he's done something wonderful.

I'm an adventurous eater, and I work out hard during the day so that I can enjoy something I like for dinner. I love sushi, curries, gyro, pho, ramen, etc etc. Boyfriend won't even try any of these, for a plethora of excuses.

I'm fine if he contains his picky eating to himself, but I'm sick of always going to his restaurants because I can find something I'll tolerate on their menus, and he won't go near any of mine. I want to be able to cook more adventurously at home (usual menu is chicken breast, rice or potatoes, green beans- BORING) without him whining and just eating a muffin or frozen pizza instead. I'm worried about his health and I resent not being able to do something I enjoy.

In the past, we've had very nonconstructive conversations about this. He got defensive, I got snarky. I need a way to reframe the issue, maybe some scripting help or practical compromises. Any ideas?

POST: A bit of background on myself: I am a photographer by trade.  Somewhat as a joke, my girlfriend has always playfully been very against my taking photos of her.  It hurt and annoyed me at first when she played coy, but eventually I just stopped trying to involve her in my work.   

She is a very attractive girl - to the point of being openly approached constantly whenever she's out at no matter the setting (work, etc).  That said, she grew into her good looks and somewhat enjoys the attention she gets now.  Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup she is a fan of.  Excited with the idea, she agreed.

At the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.  The photographer inside me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her.  The boy in me is jealous that she is so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me (taking photos) initially.  I'm also just not that comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online - perhaps a bit possessive/insecure, but I just don't love the idea of her half naked all over the internet and lastly... The boyfriend in me is being supportive and pushing her to do something she wants to even though I really feel bad about it.

We've been together for over two years without having sex. At first she was too young (14) and now she wants a time when she is free of stress so she can be relaxed and not have to worry about anything else. The.. event itself will take place in about a month, after she finishes her exams. We've considered it now and then through the time we've been together but always decides to wait.

Now it isn't being put off any longer. And, while it has been a TORTUROUS wait for me (worth it, to be with someone like her), it suddenly seems... rather sudden and immediate. 

God knows I want to, and I definitely don't want to wait any longer, but at the same time I don't know how I'm going to be fully ready by the time it happens. 

I understand on an intellectual level that it is not that big a deal. Just sex, right? But emotionally it seems like a great deal more than that.

And I know that it is for her. We're very open in discussing these matters. To her this is a really big deal; her virginity is something she can only ever give to one person and she wants it to be meaningful. It's sharing a more intimate part of herself than she ever has before.

I understand and even agree with her. But that kind of adds pressure to the situation. I don't want to screw up and make her first time something she doesn't want to remember. And I don't know if worrying about it will just make it more likely to happen.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking here. As much a chance to just talk about it as possible,I guess; my only confidante aside from my girlfriend is asexual, and as such she can't give much input here. But do I really have anything to worry about? Just how badly CAN I screw this up? And is there anything I definitely, definitely shouldn't do?

He started texting me less and no longer asked me how my day was and that's when I realized that I have feelings for him, and it shocked me how intense they were. I was thinking about him 24/7 and it affected me in a negative way. I no longer wanted to hang out with anyone, I got bad grades in all my classes and I just slept all the time. The texting almost stopped right now. I still see at school everyday and we spend our breaks together, he's nice when I'm with him and still teases me and jokes around.

Right now, I don't know what to do and I'm not sure what he's thinking, I sometimes wonder if he just doesn't want spend our break time with me but is too nice to say so and I wonder if I pushed him away when I was having a hard time controlling my feelings when I'm around him by being cold and ignoring him. I want to stop thinking about him and move on. I really want to focus on school and get good grades since is not too late.
Distancing myself from him is not an option at this point since we are taking the same classes. Also, I can never be in a relationship with him because of some circumstances. How do I stop being so miserable all the time? How do I stop waiting for his texts when I know he won't be sending me anything? Is it possible to get over him and still be friends? He hasn't done anything wrong and it doesn't feel right to be mean to him. Please help me!!

TITLE: My roommate has told me many disgusting band camp stories and so I'm curious: What are YOUR most horrifying stories from band and/or camp?
POST: The main story that stuck with me involved my roommate and this guy that everyone in the band absolutely hated. For the life of me, I can't remember his name, so I'll call him ""Dave"". Dave apparently was an asshole to everyone and if there's anything to take away from this story, it's to not piss off band geeks.

My roommate's high school band was traveling by bus to a school in a different city for a competition. Dave had been messing with the people in band all week and as a band member himself, would be accompanying them to the competition. The bus ride was going to take around 4-5 hours and a group of trombone guys (including my roommate) decided it would be a great opportunity to get back at Dave. They sneaked into the band room, opened Dave's trombone case, and stole his mouthpiece.

One by one, the guys took turns jacking off into it. One of the them stuck it up his ass. Another pissed on it.

They made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May. For 5 hours, that mouthpiece sat roasting in shit and piss and semen like a fetish-loving prostitute in the trunk of a car. When the bus finally stopped, Dave took it out and played his trombone as if not a single thing was wrong.

TITLE: My thoughts on my own Christmas this year - am I doing the right thing?
POST: Firstly - sorry for the 'downer' on a day like today - just really on my mind.

Well Reddit, another year has come around and its Christmas - I work in retail so I'm surrounded by people that are talking about doing everything with the family and friends, buying presents for everyone, so on and so fourth.

With my career, and it being my own choice, I sometimes have to move to different places to manage stores, its still a yes/no choice but to move up its something that I have to do and shouldn't really say NO to, as its something that is somewhat required of you (see of it as, what are you willing to give up to get a chance of a life time) - although I'm starting to think just how much of my own life am I giving up to chase my dreams?

I don't live with my family anymore, and I'm roughly 1200km from them (not much, I know, but we are talking about $600 in flights, possibly more for return) - my girlfriend is now even further away, and shits getting pretty tough there too with the distance and not being able to be there for each other.

I left most of my friends, and rarely hear from them now (could be partly my fault not speaking to them either, but frankly I'm pretty busy most of the time and we just end up drifting apart).

So reddit, without giving you the entire life story, I ask for your guidance:

My job could potentially give me (X) amount of money to live comfortably for the rest of my life, filling a dream that I fill I would love to achieve - but in the process losing the closeness of friends, family and loved ones - but possibly getting them back in the end?

Or do I get out now, move back to family and loved ones (in an area possibly without as good job prospects and in some ways settle for 'second best' or have to work even harder to get where I want to be?

If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them - I mean, I don't have anything to do today on Christmas, right? I'm alone and self reflecting!
TL;DR: ","I'm doubting my choices and its not even the new year - stay with my current job (possibly dreams/aspirations), potentially lose loved ones/family OR leave all that and go back to them"

TITLE: Me [30 M] with my wife [27 F] of several months, and a tax disagreement?
POST: I'll do my best to keep this concise.

My wife has a chronic illness. As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.

Our state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.

The trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer. Long story short, she's going to lie on her taxes and file as ""Single"" and obviously I have to as well. 

I am incredibly uncomfortable with lying on my taxes but both she and her mom (who was, to be fair, a tax attorney) think it should be okay for one year. I would imagine most people wouldn't lie to say they were *single* on their taxes, so I guess there's that.

I don't see a realistic way for us to afford coverage through my employer, unfortunately. I'd love for this to be a ""put my foot down"" moment but if that results in her losing coverage I don't think I can justify it.

We all have to make sacrifices in marriage ... is this a reasonable one for me to make? I guess worst-case scenario is we get caught and busted for a large fine. Which puts us back on square one (or square 0.5, due to the fines ...)

TITLE: I [F24] am not looking for a relationship, but am infatuated with my coworker [M26]
POST: I [F24] moved overseas for work about 18 months ago, breaking up with my boyfriend of 5 years to do so. I'm convinced the break up was the right thing to do, but it's hit us both very hard and I don't feel ready to move on yet.

When I started working at my new job, I immediately noticed that one of my coworkers, Mark [M26] was pretty cute, but didn't give it much more thought. The two of us are the youngest members of our team by a significant margin. We happen to come from the same country, he's been here for about 3 years. There aren't many young single women in my industry, so for the first few months I was swamped with suitors, but Mark (as is proper for a coworker) never showed any sign of interest.

About 6 months ago my team moved offices, and I had to start sharing an office with Mark. Naturally we started to casually chat more once we were crammed in the same 12 square yards for 9 hours a day, and I've slowly started to develop an irrational infatuation with him. I get unjustifiably upset if he calls in sick for the day, or even just shows up a little late in the mornings. He's perfectly friendly with me, but has never shown any sign of wanting to have any social interaction outside of a work context (I do meet with other coworkers outside of work sometimes). He's straight but been single the whole time I've been working here.

This infatuation is stupid, I'm not ready to start dating again, I know that coworkers are totally a no-go zone, he's shown no interest in me, and I don't actually think we'd even be particularly compatible. I haven't let my infatuation get in the way of my work, if anything I'm working longer hours because he tends to leave later than I would otherwise. I know I have to get over him, but I just don't know how to go about it since rationally I don't want to look for or get into any kind of non-platonic relationship with any guy right now. Advice, please!

TITLE: Difficult situation. I (m29) am in love with one of my best friends (f28).
POST: Here's my situation:

I am in love with my good friend and coworker. We've both worked at the same ad agency in NYC for several years and over that time have developed a really solid friendship. We often talk, half-jokingly, about how we should travel together. Now there is a chance that our company might send us both abroad to work on a project together. I know she also really values our friendship, but I can't tell if her feelings go any deeper than that, like mine do.

Things are a little complicated by the fact that as long as I've known her she's had a long-term boyfriend, except for a short period last year when they took a ""break"".  It's also complicated because we're all part of the same friend group so I often have to see them together, which is usually torture for me. I'm not exactly buddies with her bf, but we have many friends in common. 

So, what do I do?  Do I just tell her how I feel and risk alienating myself from our group and possibly losing her as a friend (while still having to work with her)?  Do I wait and hope that things eventually fizzle out for good with her bf? Or do I just accept that I might never be with her and try to enjoy the strong friendship we have.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

6 months ago, my younger brother explained to my mom that he found the doctor that he had his sports physical with ""creepy"" and that he didn't want to go back to him again.  He explained that the doctor had touched him for a long time, but my mom thought that it was just his reaction to having his first physical without her in the room.  6 months later, after learning of similar charges being brought against the doctor by others, my mom talked to him and he confessed that he knew what the doctor had done was wrong, and that it had really scared him.  I won't go into any details, but what he described was indisputably molestation.  My mom is afraid to press charges because she doesn't want him to have to describe the situation any more than he already has.

She is also (after having done photography for only 6 months) getting paid work, I have yet to have this, and it really is sheer luck but the very first ""collaboration"" we did together she had a model and invited me along (all fine) I said ""hey I know this awesome spot, and I have all this paint, and here is some awesome stuff we could do!"" then she posted all her photos before I did and didnt mention me so everyone thinks I copied her, and it has worked that way for many things to follow and I am just wondering how you people deal with being enraged at someone who you cannot avoid, also I think if I blatantly stop talking to her the rest of the people around us will think I am the one being a bitch, which also bothers me, what do I do?

I've been dating my SO (34M) for about a month so I don't need to worry overly much about this right away, but I like to be prepared. I'm looking for the time frames that you experienced with landmarks in your relationships, to give me a ballpark. Examples include:

- When did you exchange keys?
- When did you first say ""I love you""?
- When did you start to feel like your respective homes were a place you could ""feel at home"", i.e. you would do dishes or help with chores even though the place wasn't your own?
- When did you start farting around each other?

Things like that. What do you consider landmarks? When did they happen?

We spend most of our time at my place for convenience and he seems to fit in to my home nicely. He is comfortable making breakfast or doing dishes and has offered to help with other chores if I happen to need to do them when he's over. So far I've turned down his offer to help with other chores, but I do appreciate the gesture.

I have a history of moving in too soon, so I know I need to wait QUITE a while before I ever even consider that move. Like, over a year. At least. I just don't know how the rest of it should/could play out. I do expect some widely varied answers, so any details as to why you think it was good timing/later than normal/sooner than normal would be much appreciated.

TITLE: I love my wife [29/f] but I feel like something is missing [28/m].
POST: I have been married for about 3 years now and I absolutely love my wife. She has been the best partner I have ever had. We have had ups and downs but we always seem to work things out and we have a healthy sex life. Things are going well but I just can not seem to shake the feeling that I want more. I have lived a prim and proper, mostly conservative lifestyle up until my later years in college. I got a taste of different types of lifestyles and I have always been amazed by them. My wife was the typical break away who decided to distance herself from her family and enjoy any experience she could. There have been tales of hitchhiking with hippys and free love and all that. She has a view of people that I never had (I have been fairly cynical) and it has enabled her to meet some very interesting people from all walks of life and allowed her to make very intimate connections with these people. Well she eventually met me and she changed my outlook on the world. 

We were married right after we both graduated from college and we have taken up a fairly traditional lifestyle. She has mostly transitioned away from the past. After I had a brief chance to experience what she had experienced and after all of her stories, I was a bit jealous. I feel like our marriage has cut me off from having those intimate experiences with anyone other than her. There is a sexual aspect to this but it is also about simple intimacy. Neither of us hinder each other in the formation of new friendships but sometimes I wish we could have more. We have briefly discussed additions in the bedroom but I have never been sure if she was actually interested or if it was just her indulging me. Plus, neither of us would know where to start. I have not really discussed this with her because I don't want to hurt her and she has a way of avoiding discussions like this. 

I have maintained the status quo and told myself that those times were over. I thought I would move on from it but even several years later I can not shake the feeling that I have repressed something within myself.

We have met already and have hung out multiple times as well as gone on a date or two. Our hang outs have been dinner, movies, and other random stuff, but we've only really been on one or two dates. The other times were with other people, so it wasn't really one-on-one. I've slept over his place a couple times, but have only had sex once. We used to talk every day, but more recently it has been every other day or every couple days. Which is fine, we have busy lives. He especially has a very busy life. 

However, I'm not sure how dating really goes. I'm not really sure what he wants, nor am I sure how to bring it up in a conversation. I deactivated my dating profile a few weeks ago because I came back to over 100 messages one day and there was no one I was really into. Also, I was a bit hung up on this guy. I recently just reactivated it, due to boredom and unsure if this guy was into me, and I've noticed he's online almost every night. I'm very much into him, but not sure if he feels the same. I'm not sure when in the ""talking"" stage, I bring this up. It seems like he is into me and I sort of had a conversation with him the other night where he said he wasn't interested in a booty call.

POST: A little background about myself: I have not been in a serious relationship since I was 21 and have only dated casually since then. I am open, available and looking for a more long-term relationship.

About a month ago, I started hanging out with this guy who I've discovered to be the most caring, kind, and encouraging individual that's been in my life recently. Signs started to show early that there was some kind of attraction between us. Here are some things that have happened in the last month (some still happening):

-prolonged eye contact and lots of easy, fun conversation
-prolonged or tight hugging
-after saying goodbye, our eyes often meet once more before departure (with smiles)
-texting everyday starting in the morning and lasting into the evening
-he has said things like ""you are the nicest person I have ever met"", ""I see you as one of the people who will always be in my life""
-while on a weekend trip with friends, he threw his arm around me while sleeping (multiple friends sharing a bed)
-he said he would treat me to dinner (which he then turned into a group thing)

A couple days ago he told me he would be gone the next week because he was going to see his girlfriend (who lives six hours drive away) and expressed that they have been having difficulties for the past six months due to the long-distance. I learned that they have been together for 3+ years. 

I love that he shows an interest in me but realistically I feel that it is unfair and that I'm being led on. I'm scared to say something because I don't want the attention to stop, but I know I am in a vulnerable position. I secretly want him to break up with his girlfriend.

What makes it worse is we always blatantly talk about marriage and kids, so it's like we're already settled down. It's nice to be comfortable with someone as I've never really been good at making friends or even interact with the opposite sex.

It's a small apartment gym. There's really no gym management to complain to. Would it be an asshole move to talk to them about this? I'm not generally good with people and I can't think of a non terrible way to tell these guys they fucking reek. I'm normally anti passive aggressive notes but would a note do it?

TITLE: When does the guy stop paying for dinner?
POST: I [27/M] recently got into a huge fight with my--now ex-- girlfriend [24/F].

We'd been dating for about 2 years at this point and I still largely pay for all of our meals as well as our apartment + utilities. I have a nice luxury loft apartment and she keeps a very small--think glorified storage closet--apt in a bad neighborhood. She literally never goes there except to pick up and drop off clothing because I don't have enough closet space for two people. She doesn't pay a penny to live in my apartment or drive my car (we split the gas costs even though she drives it 80% of the time for her work and I walk to work.)

We both have good jobs. I make about twice what she does, but I have crushing student debt that I'm trying to pay off as fast as possible. I pay off about $3.5K of student debt a month, which really cuts into my cash flow, as you can imagine. She has about 1/10 the student debt I have.

I recently started suggesting that we split our food bills more evenly. I suggested that she could pay for her own meals and I'd pay for mine. Obviously we'd still go on dates and I'd pay for her meals, but on a day to day basis, I suggested that we split the food costs.

We ended up getting into a huge fight and then lots of old, old stuff came out and we ended up breaking up.

At this point, the relationship issue is moot, but she was my first really seriously, long-term relationship.

TITLE: [16/m] How should I approach this girl? [16/f]
POST: Let's start with background information about this girl

There's this girl that I really like. We're in science class and I have free period with her. I also sometimes pass by her on the way to class everyday. In Science Class, we show little glances of each other. I'd usually look at her for a few seconds and when she looks back, I either smile or look away. Sometimes we see each other and we both smile -- but it could be that she's talking with her friends as well.

In Gym class, we notice each other but she's with her group of friends and I'm with my own group of friends. Kind of hard to get to know her. Today in gym, we actually lined up against a wall and I was next to her. I was nervous since we were both talking to our own little group of friends I guess.

We always make eye contact in some way and I feel like she might show some interest in me too. I really have a huge crush on her. What's also interesting is that prom is coming up in about a month and I really want to ask her to it -- but then again I don't know her very well. Any advice?

TITLE: Stay put, or explore?
POST: So, Reddit, I have a query for you. I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year. I could stay there and be financially secure, and make enough to get by, and facilitate some lesser hobbies of mine, but I don't think i'd ever truly be happy working there, as my co-workers make it somewhat high-stress. 
   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post.

TITLE: Revenge on a New Roommate
POST: I share an apartment with my boyfriend. There are two spare bedrooms which are a constant rotation of friends-in-need. We recently invited a friend to stay with us while she figures out what her next step in life is. 

Now, I want people to feel at home in my apartment, but she keeps moving things around so we can't find them, using things that aren't hers, and ruining our possessions. Her version of an apology is an explanation of her actions followed by, ""So I'm sorry if I am guilty, but I don't think I am.""

Last Sunday I got around to sorting through laundry she took it upon herself to wash. She ruined an expensive pair of fingerless mittens knit with alpaca yarn and she lost a prized shawl, gifted to me for being the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding this past summer. When I explained as much, and how I knew she was the guilty party, she insisted it wasn't possible she was at fault, and if she was, I shouldn't be upset with her for things she did weeks ago. 

You can understand, I'm pretty annoyed and generally disinterested in her disrespect. 

So I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed. I won't even wear any of it, but if she feels no remorse losing my shawl, I don't feel too guilty either.

As much as it sucked to hear,  I accepted it. He kept sending me messages about how much he wanted me but couldn't have me. Fast forward to yesterday when he tells me he's dating someone.

POST: This weekend my boyfriend confessed that the reason why we haven't had sex in a couple weeks is that 'when things start going well' he ruins it by getting the girl pregnant.

I am a very sexual person and if I had it my way, I'd have sex everyday, multiple times a day. So when he drops this bomb, I really don't know how to take it. I take the pill religiously, however we do not wear condoms. 

He has always been very upfront about his past --- including the abortions that he's had with multiple exes. However, when he told me that he doesn't want to have sex until we're married and ready to have kids, I was taken aback.

I want to be there for my BF and support him in anyway possible. Is there anything that can help him with the guilt and anxiety that he's feeling? Have you ever experienced this personally? Any advice would be appreciated.

I don't want to pick up guys in bars, I hate clubs. I work with older women that are settled with families, babies and belong to nappy clubs or whatever parents do.

Online dating seems good but also from old work friends experiences it can be tedious. I'm willing to give it a go despite this but have no idea what to look out for. I also don't know where to meet single people in real life.

Although both my exes have told me I'm pretty, I really don't think I am so there the whole self esteem thing. I'm friendly and flirty, but would wait for a sign someone liked me. So if I were sat in a bar I wouldn't just walk up to a strange guy and give him my number. Once I know someone I've got no problems with making moves. The thought of speed dating fills me with fear.

POST: So here's how it is: We met in high school. Became friends. Dated briefly in Year 12, but it didn't work out because we were young and I was kind of stupid. 

Since then we've always been close, despite living 3 hours away from each other. Over about 4 years, I have had spouts of falling in love with her again, only to give up after always being friendzoned.

Now I should be clear: in the past this girl has always been a bit insecure, and she dated plenty of boys to feel better about herself. After she woke up and realised how unhealthy that was, she made a decision to be single for at least a year. Now, she's happy with herself, because she took steps to change her life (yep. she's a keeper.)

So here's where I'm at now: we're both single, and we both enjoy that for now. But we're also really, REALLY close. I am crazy about her, but I have no idea whether I should give up and drift apart, or whether this could turn into a relationship in the future.

I got him this awesome Indiana Jonesy leather covered flask and a nice bottle of Abercromie & Fitch's Fierce cologne.
Well he opened his gift tonight,  and to see his face light up made me feel so happy. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed and not as appreciated. I'm really not a naggy, whiny SO. But this feeling leaves me a little sad and unimportant.  
Btw, we've been kinda together for a littler over a year.

TITLE: My wife of three months threatened to move out.
POST: Backstory: Been with her for about 4 years, things were great.  3 months ago we get married. We both work a lot, opposite schedules, and rarely see each other.  We bought a farm together, and have been settling in there too. Gradually she has withdrawn to the point of frigidity, and basic intimacy, holding hands, kissing, smiling. She comes home exhausted and sits there, at times I have to wrestle basic sentences out of her.  She says it's stress from work, and not to worry. I started picking up her end of basic work around the house and farm to help her out with stress. Still though whenever I try to do anything special, or social with her she always resists it, with rules, stipulations, or being negative, and an overall close-minded downer. Not her personality at all, but there it is time and time again. Conversely, she also will go and hang out with her friends over night regularly with carefree ease.  

Yesterday, as I serve her breakfast she says that, she doesn't take care of me.

Whenever we have time off she flees from my presence. Today, Thanksgiving was no different.  She talks about driving over an hour away to her friends McMansion for a Walmart thanksgiving. I reminded her of years past when we have done that and she ended up being exhausted at the end of the day, she just got off a 15 hour shift. She also never framed it within the context of me coming along, and left me saying she was only going to be there a few hours. 

Even though she works at a grocery store and finds it impossible to bring food home. I went and got ingredients for at least a home cooked meal tonight.  Well I fell asleep, waiting for her. Got a text at one in morning saying that she was going midnight shopping.  So I finally called her out for being inconsiderate, and wish her a happy thanksgiving. 

She now wants to come get her dog and leave. Then goes on (via text) about how she constantly fails and pretends to be happy around me for months, and she should just grab her dog, who is attached at the hip to my dog, and leave.

So we're at my place and things get hot and heavy and we begin kissing and taking off clothes. First off, the furthest I've gotten with a girl before this was a blowjob when I was drunk at a party. Anyway, clothes are off and I'm hard as a rock waiting to go.

I go down on her and I'm still rock hard and she climaxes and she's ready to return the favor to me. When she goes to blow me I start to go soft for some reason. I;m trying to concentrate on her and the generous, hot action she's doing but I just can't focus. I'm so confused and to compensate for that I go down on her again and the erection returns.

She says she wants me to fuck when I'm done going down on her and I get up to fuck her and I lose the hard on again. After that she was accepting and said we could wait (I'm still a virgin) for the next time we get together. I'm not sure why I kept losing the hard on when it mattered. If it changes anything I always over think things and I'm in my own head a lot.

TITLE: Thoughts on a prenup
POST: I proposed last weekend. We've talked about it for a long time, I just finally got around to doing it. 

Now to the important stuff. We've been together for over 5 years, lived together for four. She's extremely responsible with her money, which is one of the reasons I haven't really thought I needed one. She pays me a set amount a month for rent, we just kind of split other things like groceries and such. I'd say I generally pay for going out to eat, vacations, etc. But I make a lot more than she does, so I don't have a problem with that. Even though we have separate accounts, I'd say we both consider things ours. I do own a house, but like I said, she's paying a little over a 3rd of that payment a month.

I don't want to sound like I have love blinders on, I'm a pessimist generally, but I can't really see the need for one. If something ever did happen where we got divorced, which I really can't see but I know people change, should I still get one? Honestly if that happened, I know myself, and I'd be civil and fair about who get's what, I could guarantee that. I really couldn't see her being any other way either, we're a lot a like that way.

We're not going to have kids, and if we did split, I'd feel she was owed at minimum, all of the money she paid towards the house, if not half of the house itself. 

So, should I still look into getting one? Feel free to be as critical as possible about my views on things. She already asked me if I wanted one, as I technically have more assets than her (even though I consider them ours), so getting one wouldn't be an issue. I feel the fact that she asked that speaks to her financial responsibility.

TITLE: Foot swollen after Salicylic acid wart treatment
POST: Hi there,

Basically, I have had a plantars wart on my right big toe for almost two years and the past couple weeks I have been fighting it pretty relentlessly. I have been doing freeze treatments, applying salicylic acid, and removing layers of dead skin.

The last time I removed skin was on Monday night. I got deep enough that I felt I was almost at the base of the wart. In an attempt to get closer to the bottom, I picked at the wart with my pocket knife (consistently disinfected the knife and my foot with lots of rubbing alcohol and wore gloves). I got deep but only deep enough to draw a tiny amount of blood. I then started reapplying my Salicylic acid treatment to the area from that night until this (Wednesday) morning.

Today, my toe was very sore all day at work, and stung fairly sharply on the spot of my wart. I figured it might be from the salicylic acid, so when I got home from work, I soaked my toe in apple cider vinegar in an attempt to remove the dried acid. However, this didn't get rid of all of it. Also, at this point, I realized my toe and was getting fairly warm and swollen, and that the rest of my foot was getting a bit warm as well. After this, I took some isopropyl alcohol and a knife, and gently rubbed/peeled away all the visible dried acid left on my toe. However, my toe doesn't feel any better. I am currently laying with it raised and covered in neosporin.

Long story short, should I be concerned about some sort of infection or anything? Or could this just be a normal response to my treatment? I have no known allergies, other serious medical conditions, or anything like that. I am a 20 year old white male and am (hopefully) healthy.

Thank you!

Here's the story: I'm 35 years old, a Marine Corps veteran and a married father of 3. At this time, my wife doesn't earn much at all and we're barely making it on my blue-collar income of around 43-48k/year (depends on overtime availability).

I'm terrified that despite my education, I won't be able to move into anything that pays more than I'm currently making ""right out of the gate"", so to speak.

I'm not afraid to move if I have to, and I can learn pretty much anything I need to. My BA will be in ""Integrative Leadership Studies"", which is just a generic Adult Degree program at my college.

POST: About 8 months ago we had a very bad fight. She had caught me in a lie (nothing about cheating, but it was something I lied about my past that was important to her). She was on the verge of breaking up with me. All of a sudden, we were fine about a few weeks later, and we rarely fought about that reason. 

Now, I just came to realize after a breakdown she had, that she may actually want to break up with me but she can't because she relies upon me greatly (much greater than I thought) for financial reasons. Basically she'd be out on the street and so would her mom (she sends her money from her part time job). If it were only her she said she could be ""free"" in her own words (but I think she might have been implying that she *would* be free if she had the chance.

I'm not 100% sure what she was saying, that she *would* definitely not be with me now if it weren't for financial support, or that she is just upset because she doesn't at least have that choice. 

I can't figure it out, and I am devistated obviously! She just went to sleep and I don't even know what to do. 

I don't want to force someone to be with me while they don't want this, love isn't a one way street. Even if she tries to ""make the best of it"" to be with me, I only want someone with me who's in it 100%, especially since we plan on getting married. 

What to do? If I leave her because she's not 100% (or so I think) I would feel guilty, on top of that, her and her mom on the street (or at the very best couch surfing with relatives).

POST: I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last 2 years, when Thanksgiving and Christmas came along, we spent it with our own families. His family lives 5 hours away from my family, so it's not very realistic to spend one day with one family, and then go to the other one's the next day. I would really love to spend a holiday with my boyfriend, but I feel bad for my parents. His family makes a much bigger deal out of holidays than mine, and he likes his family a lot more than I like my family so I can't convince him to come spend the holiday with my family. Thanksgiving is tomorrow and I could still go with him to his parent's house over mine, but I hardly ever see my parents. My parents are currently spending a lot of money on me to put me through school, so I feel like it's really selfish of me to ditch my parents to spend Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family.

So I guess the main question is: Should I go ahead and finally spend a holiday with my boyfriend of 3 years, or should I spend it with my parents since they've been such good parents and I feel bad?

And for another question... How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future so that everyone is happy?
TL;DR: ","We are not used to spending the holiday without our parents and feel bad about doing it, but we also want to finally spend a holiday together since we haven't in the three years of being together."

TITLE: I hate a majority of the females in my age group.
POST: 23 year old male here. I don't know what else to say about this other than I hate the personalities of the 21 to 28 year old female population. A majority of them are completely superficial and have no drive beyond being the pretty girl or the object of physical desire. Having a conversation with them is like pulling teeth and hardly consists of any real or meaningful topics. Drinking, social media, and 'pretty' things. Basically the only three things that matter to women in this age bracket.

I know I know... This is not true for everyone/fuck stereotyping/everyone is an individual bullshit. But seriously, take a look at your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account. You'll find a majority of this to be true. And of course you'll find the great ones who are just awesome people, but I feel like they are rare and very much exceptions to the rule. 

I compare them to the women I work with, who are around 30+ years of age, and the personal experiences I have had with them. A higher percentage of these women are incredibly funny with a deeper sense of humor, enjoy a broad range of topics in conversation, and treat people with much more respect.

TITLE: Filming inside an airport, is it illegal?
POST: Ok, heres the story:

I was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us ""We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there."" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer ""You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!"" (in portuguese). 

Thats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: ""You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away."" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. 

So reddit? Is it wrong to film inside an airport? Was she right and I wrong?

POST: We've dated for about a month and a half. She wanted a serious relationship. To preface the situation - she told me about a time when she was having exams, and she vomited. Her parents or boyfriend at the time would take care of her.

I came down with a bad fever and was coughing blood. I took a week off school and work. She took time off studying to spend half a day taking care of me. Two days later, she has her final exam. While I'm at home recovering, she calls me to let me know that she feels extremely ill and threw up in the middle of her exam. I tell her that she should call 911 immediately as I won't be able to come to her and she does that, and is hospitalized for the day. I do not visit her, as I feel quite sick and fear that I may have passed something to her.

The next day, she goes home to recover, but is still feeling quite down. I go to visit my parents to pick up some mail. I ask if she needs anything at this time, and she declines, telling me that she doesn't need me to help her now.

A week later, she tells me that she wants to break up over the situation. Her friend had to take care of her in the hospital, and he asked where her boyfriend (me) was. She also pointed out that I was feeling good enough to visit my parents. I was still coughing blood and had a fever at that point, and wasn't thinking very clearly. I had feared that I may have passed something to my girlfriend and that visiting her in the hospital could be bad for both of us.

The title says what happened. this girl i had been associating with we were a great team, always fun, always laughs always a good time. we were close. she came onto me strong out of her relationship. but in the end decided to go back to him.

perhaps not directly, but her life is such a mess and he is the only one that can give her stability because he does everything she asks him to. always awaiting a command always willing to let her if need be even cheat on him so long as it suits her needs.

I didn't let that happen. and its caused such a rift between us that its now over. and here i sit. day 5 into no contact. not because i want to get her back but just because i can't deal with the pain knowing her ex is always around or some other guy is always around. the questions the insecurity the sleepless nights wondering if she's snuggling up to another man that's not me. 

She contact me on the second day of no contact sending me a video of her doing cute things basically a movie version of a selfie and how she couldn't stop thinking about me. I ignored it answered the next day saying ""loved the video"" and that was it. She keeps liking my pics on instagram its like she's still with me but not. its just silence.

TITLE: My [18M] Girlfriend [17F] lives in an abusive household
POST: Hello, Reddit.  I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.

First off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.

My girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  

Even when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.

My mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.  I would love to hear reddit's opinion and if you guys think there's anything we can do to help her.  We are all here to support and and do whatever we can.

TITLE: I'm [M20] worried about emotional manipulation from girlfriend [F20].
POST: I've found recently that my girlfriend has been saying things which make me feel uncomfortable dye to the way they're said. We're not doing great at the minute so I'm concerned this is changing my thinking. 

Essentially, we had an argument recently and now talking between us is more stilted (we're in different countries right now, by the way). The things that have me worried are when she says things like she needs to talk to me to distract her from thinking about hurting herself and that she ""hopes I know"" she's depending on me to make her happy. 

I don't want to seem overly selfish, I'm concerned about that. Of course I want to help and I have for as long as we have been dating (around a year and a half now). It just feels like some of these things are more of a threat than asking for help. This is partially caused by the fact that when I try to offer suggestions they're met with rejection as being too hard, not what she wants as the solution or simply as not going to work. 

I feel guilty writing this and I feel guiltier that I've been considering the future of our relationship recently. It feels like she's making sure I know just how guilty I should feel if I left. This is made worse by her recently accusing me of fostering her dependency on me while I'm not dependant on her (I'm not sure how I did this and when I tried to offer her ways of becoming more independent they were shot down). 

Am I being selfish here and thinking too much about my self, not enough about her? I do want to help and I don't want to make it all about me but these thoughts keep coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do so any advice is appreciated. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before?
Am I wrong here and being overly defensive or is this manipulative?
Most importantly, where do I go from here?

TITLE: I think my beagle is sick. Can anyone offer any insight/share any similar experiences? (x-post /r/beagle)
POST: So last Friday (March 29th) my 5 and a half year old beagle, Miles, started acting weirdly. He would start shaking and quietly whining. My family and I chalked it up to being in a new environment since we brought him to stay with us overnight at my grandparents' new home. This wasn't too worrying to us, since Miles is epileptic (relatively common among beagles) and we assumed he was having a mild seizure. But the problem persisted through the night and every couple hours he would start shaking again on every inhale. Also, he refuses to jump onto the furniture he knows he's allowed on; he chooses to stay on the floor and whine or I have to pick him up to be on the furniture with me. What I noticed starting yesterday is that he seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches. I tried lightly poking him in those areas every couple of hours and every time I do, he yelps. 

Throughout all of this I noticed what worries me the most. As any beagle owner would know, beagles can't shut up around food. Never before has Miles acted calm around food, let alone slept in his kennel during Easter lunch in a strange environment. He won't run up to snatch a treat out of my hand, either. I have to offer it to him a few inches from his nose, or, if I throw it on the floor he might be bothered to mosey on over and chomp it up very slowly. 

Does anyone know what may be wrong with him?

TITLE: [insurance] I can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family
POST: Okay... Long story short.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. 

We went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)

I would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.

Sorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.

TITLE: Me [26F] with my boyfriend [37M] of 11 months, long distance relationship says I'm being to needy.
POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months, the first few months of which we lived in the same city. He recently moved away for work and we are now living in different countries.

  If I had my way we would be texting trough out the day because that's just the way I operate and when something noteworthy happens, he is the first I want to tell. That doesn't go over well with him because he feels like I am bombarding him and he can't get other things done, which I'm fine with. I've been trying to keep my texting to minimum. 

 We've also had other issues where he was feeling suffocated when I wanted to spend the night with him most nights, but we worked through it.

 So right now we are trying to make this long distance thing work and I know he doesn't like to text or be texted a lot so I suggested (after reading a whole bunch of long distance relationship tips online) that the first person to wake up or go to bed would text the other goodnight or good morning. That way we know we are thinking about each other and it's a way to keep our everyday contact alive even if we are thousands of miles away.

 While he initially liked the idea and texted goodnight and good morning he has not done so these past couple days. I brought it up to him and he got very defensive and said that I was being needy and that he doesn't want to text me because he HAS to be because he WANTS to, which I totally understand. Except when I've tried to just let things flow I'll get one text every two days and that's just not enough I feel to keep a long distance relationship alive. So I would like an outside opinion on this; Am I being to needy? Should I just be grateful for the attention he gives me and leave it at that?

TITLE: How shitty of a person am I?
POST: This is a throw-away, and as kind and respectful as you are Reddit, I want your honest opinions.

Over the weekend, I ended up sleeping with two different girls within about a 14 hour period.

The first girl was early in the day, maybe 1-2pm.  I was talking to her and asked her to come over and get lunch and make out.  Her and I have sort of dating the last year.  I say sort of because it has never been official, we've discussed it numerous times and never decided to make it exclusive.  We have sort of a cutesy relationship in terms of how we act around each other, so it's not a clean pump and dump.  She lives about an hour and a half away, and I see her maybe once a month if that.  We're kind of on the tail-end of whatever it was we've been doing for the last year or so.

Then later that night another girl called and asked to hang out.  She has a thing for me, and I'm conflicted.  She's cool, and a solid friend, but sometimes attractive to me, sometimes not.  Everything was normal, and we watched a couple episodes of LOST, and then I told her I wanted to go to sleep (asleep sleep).  Then jokingly asked her if she wanted to start drinking, somehow we ended up drinking, and 2 hours or so later, she told me she was tired and we needed to go lay-down.  We have a slight history of hooking up.  Like twice in a couple of months.  Anyway, she obviously stayed the night, and we ended up sleeping together.  How should I feel about myself for doing this?

TITLE: I [17M] am confused as to what I want with my gf [18F] of a little over a year
POST: We started dating my junior, her senior year and have been ever since. Now I am a senior and she is away at a college within reasonable driving distance. I love her and she loves me. While we are content with each other (we like to see each other, like some of the same things) I do have a few concerns about us. 

1) I have never had another serious relationship with anyone else. I feel like I cant make an informed decision of weather I an truly happy here unless I take some time to sort me out and try dating some other people to see what its like.

2) While some of our interests overlap, other things don't mix, our love languages are different (I'm big on touch, her not so much, but she puts up with it to an extent), we like different kinds of movies and stuff etc

3) Our families are from different socioeconomic classes, mine higher than hers. This isin't a big deal to me, but it adds stress to when I think about a possible future for us (how we would deal with bills/stuff, her family (and extended family) structure is different, much larger than mine and just a completely different dynamic).

4) While every time I have told her I love her, I have 100% meant it, I think I'm too young to choose a forever partner. I think I need to build my own life and see what else is out there.

I have been discussing this with her and we considered an open relationship so I can see what else is out there, and while she agreed at the time, I don't think she is ok with me being with anyone else while we are ""together"", which I completely understand, but in that case I don't want to string her along if the end goal is to just be ""ok"" this year and break it off when I go to college net year. 

She says I'm selfish, and I agree, but I'm having to weigh my love for her vs. doing what is best for me.

TITLE: How do I [22M] confront my friend (and ex girlfriend) [21F] about my remaining feelings for her
POST: Recently myself [22M] and a friend of three years [21F] (not close, on and off) hooked up and from there began a relationship. We dated for four months before she called time on it in January because she ""wanted to be alone"" and by herself for the last few months of our last year of University (although she followed this up by saying she would probably ""regret"" her decision in a few weeks and that I was ""the best"" boyfriend she'd ever had, great closure, huh?).

I understand all her reasoning behind it, the last year being stressful and to add a relationship onto that would be extra tough. However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted ""No Contact"" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party/gathering with her and have everything rush back.

I'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.

I don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly. I was thinking of inviting her to have lunch at a neutral location (a cafe on campus or similar) and talking to her there.

So, the crux of the matter is what do I say and how do I go about it? I don't want her to feel like its her fault or that I'm going to ignore her / be a dick about it. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: Me [23 M/F] with my two best friends who date each other [22 M and F] of 4 years, found out one cheated and need advice
POST: Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.

Earlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like ""2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies"" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. 

Now, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. 

I know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.

So reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

TITLE: I want to understand his point of view on this monogamy issue...
POST: ok.  We have been together 5 years, me and his both 24.  I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner

Quick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  

Similar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.

This local business hired me, I told them upfront I had no experience but was a quick learner. They started me off first day as a dishwasher, and I handled it fine. The second day they wanted to start training me as a busboy and ease my way into a serving position. I was so excited for this opportunity to move up that quickly. I paid close attention, asked a question for clarity when I didn't understand something, and made sure that the guests were well attended to. At the end of the night they told me good job and though there were a few things I needed to work on they didn't expect much for my first try at it. 
I go into work today and the manager (who wasn't there the night before) sat me down and told me that they were letting me go because they didn't feel I wasn't good enough and that they needed someone with more restaurant experience.

I mean, I'm smart I'm competent I feel like I'll pick things up once I get a hang of things. 

I've been scrolling through Craigslist the past few hours looking at more restaurant positions and all of them say the same thing ""2+ years experience required."" Even a dish washing position is required to have multiple years of experience. I feel like the problem out there isn't that there aren't any jobs, there's tons of them I just looked at. It's just the pool of unemployed is so large that businesses are demanding the highest of qualifications for some of the most entry leveled jobs. So my question is how is someone who isn't as qualified compete in our world today?

POST: Not sure if this is the best subreddit but I'm at a restaurant in Italy on my iPhone and I couldn't find anything better. I have AT&T and paid for 500 texts for while I'm here. I just checked my at&t app and it says I've used 57/500 texts, but I'm pretty sure between sending and receiving its been more. Does it charge for both, or just sending?
I've been texting my boyfriend who is in California, he has Verizon. Does it charge him to text me while I'm here? I figured it would charge me both ways and the 500 I bought would cover it but now I'm concerned since it only says I've used 57. I haven't counted I'm just pretty sure it's more.

TITLE: I am [19F], and my mother wouldn't approve of me 'online dating'.
POST: I'm so sorry this is all so muddled, I just don't know how to explain it properly. Also wasn't sure what to flair this as, so I just put it as 'dating'.

I am a 19 year old female, never had a boyfriend and only had my first kiss a few months ago, so I'm relatively 'innocent'. I know Tinder isn't really a ""dating app"" but I installed it a few months ago just for fun, until it turned into me actually agreeing to meet up with guys who I hit it off with. But I'm facing the problem of my mother, who I haven't told that I'm meeting people online, because I know she would get angry or not allow me to meet people.

I've only met one guy from Tinder in real life, and the only reason I did was because I lied to my mum about where I was. Today I was supposed to meet up and have lunch with another guy I met on Tinder, so I told my mum I was having lunch with a boy in the city. I was contemplating just saying I was having lunch with friends, but decided to tell her i was going with a boy, but not that I met him online. Then I realised that i made a massive mistake, as now I have practically dug a grave for myself, when i told her I met him locally when he actually lives nearly and hour and a half away, and became really evasive about other details. So I ended up cancelling the date, and I'm going to be questioned SO much by my mum that i'm going to have to confess that I lied and that I met him online, and that's going to cause a bit of strife.

I feel so pathetic about virtually needing my mother's consent to go and meet people! I know about 'stranger danger' and am safe when it comes to this, so how do I go about meeting people from online with my mother being so over-protective? I honestly don't know how anyone my age does it.

Well the moment i entered the party she made it pretty clear where we both stand. 

She was already drunk and was quite touchy. When we were alone i went for the kiss and we made out a couple of minutes until she had to go back to the party. 

Well over the time of the party we made out on and off when we had time and space. 

We both were now pretty clear that we wanted more. 

The problem was that we had to wait for the party to end. Wellll that didnt happen. I eventually left at 5 in the morning tired we agreed that i d call her the next day.

This stuff was really heavy, so I wasn't really looking down, scanning the road for potential shit for my feet to squish; I just wanted to get home quickly before my arms separated from my body. You can probably guess what happened next, I stamped on a surprisingly large piece of dog shit. Or maybe it could be human shit, who knows. I don't know my shit. I didn't know what to do. My house was just two blocks away, but I didn't want to keep walking in my shitty slippers. So I decided I'd try to shake most of the shit off of it. I shook. Nothing happened. I shook harder. Nothing happened. This shit was made of super glue. I see the old lady who always wants to start a conversation with me for some reason; she's approaching me. I freak out. My arms pain really bad. So I shake my slipper really violently, and it comes off and flies right at the old. It hit her left boob, shit side up. I didn't know what to do, again. I was freaking out even more now. I had two options— wait, apologise, take my shitty slipper home and have a fucking long conversation with the annoying lady; or run home one slipper less. I really didn't want to talk to the lady, and eh, I could buy new slippers. I had just a few seconds before she approached; the shock of the flying shitty slipper was still with her. I committed, and ran— nay, wobbled like a penguin wearing one slipper. This still isn't over. The handles of one of the bags tore. It fell off. I lost my wobble-rhythm and the other one fell too. I lost my balance and fell with it. I just left all the stuff there and sprinted home.
I don't know what I'm going to tell my mom.

   A week went by and I tried talk to her and she just seemed really distant, like she almost wanted nothing to do with me. We had this off and on relationship of her being really flirty and then really distant. This has lasted 5 weeks. This [thread] I posted in r/teenrelationships sums it up pretty well. 

   Anyways, I'm ready to make one last ditch effort/try to move on. What I'm asking for is advice on this one matter: Should I tell her how I feel? I think it could help me get my feelings for her off of my chest and make it easier to move on. On the other hand, if she gets all touched and stuff and wants to go out with me after that, then hey, that's great.

   I do realize that telling girls how you feel isn't really fair to them by overloading them with all of that baggage. I do realize that I could create a completely irreparable relationship with this girl. I'm just ready to make one last ditch effort, or make an effort to move on.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my married online friend [30 F] 3 months, strained emotional relationship
POST: I posted a few weeks back but deleted the post. The summary of the situation is this: I met a female gamer playing an mmo who is currently married with two kids  and is in an emotionally abusive marriage. She has been in this marriage for 10 years. My insecurities caused a rift and our contact has become strained. 

We became close, feelings were very strong and we professed our mutual love for each other. We chatted and Skyped often. 

In time, though, my insecurities and unease with the situation placed stress upon us both which has brought me to where we are. I tried to break off contact two weeks ago and stated as such. She was devastated and I ended up being unable to follow through. We decided our best bet was to try and remove the emotional side from it and I have been unable to do so.

I've really struggled with everything. I feel like I love this woman and I know that my constant worries and questions caused the rift. It became very hard to not feel sad when her husband would call and interrupt our Skype sessions. Or when she suddenly changed factions in the game we played and seemed no longer wanting to play with me. I would make my feelings known and she tried to reassure me. It all became too much, as she felt as if it wasn't enough and she couldn't be enough. 

This past week, I told her that I couldn't handle just being friends right now and I should try to take some space. She explained that she doesn't feel the same as she once did and she doesn't know what the future holds. She said she isn't able to write things off for good yet but space and time are important. 

My questions are this:

Is there hope or is it worth holding out hope for a future? 
Am I wrong to feel so bad about how I handled the situation?
How can I overcome my insecurities relative to this situation?

TITLE: I sent my estranged friend an anonymous letter and I don't know how to process the response. Advice would be appreciated.
POST: She and I met in freshman year (I was 18, she 17) as neighbors in our dorm. We lived together for several years (about 3) but at some point started to have our insecurities interfere with our relationship. Our friendship faced several set backs and pretty much fizzled out in a rather dramatic fashion. At first this was okay. I was angry and couldn't communicate or forgive. At the time I didn't want to acknowledge that I had made mistakes too. 

A long while had gone by since I'd thought about her. I've been dealing with a lot and have kind of gone down this hermit path, I honestly have no friends in the city I live in. In my loneliness, the thoughts of our good times came to mind and I just started missing her so much. Now go to several days ago - I sent my friend an anonymous message on tumblr basically saying I loved them and always will. Of course this could be interpreted both as friendship-love or romantic, so this could have been unclear. A few messages later (still anonymous) it was basically said that she had realized who it was and that they had let it go (meaning our past problems). 

QUESTION: Now in my note I had hinted I wanted to rekindle our friendship so, should I take this 'all is forgiven' attitude as she is over the past and that's it- no chance; or, is the person over the past and open to something? Sorry that was pretty drawn out or if this all seems petty. It's just this person meant so much to me at one point. My feelings got hurt and I hurt their feelings, and then it was just done. Time has passed, making reconciliation that much more unlikely.

* I love the guy and he loves me
* My parents and family love him, which is very important to me
* We agree on all fundamental values & beliefs
* We talk about getting married in general
* He makes me laugh
* He is so smart and caring
* I trust him with absolutely no reservations 
* He is the kindest, most wonderful person in the world and I've never met anyone who didn't like him  

**But**  

* Though we've talked about marriage, there's no proposal/engagement/plan with real goals
* We've been together for so long that I don't remember what it's like to be myself
* I'm attracted to more than one person outside of the relationship, and that terrifies me
* I hate it when I feel like I have to drag him to go out and have fun/justify wanting to go out and have fun (like at bars, dancing, etc)
* He still has 3 more years of school left and that seems like such a long time to wait to settle down
* I feel like I'm trying to justify being unhappy because our relationship is wonderful on paper and I feel like I'm just a shitty whiner/guilty about wanting something different

TITLE: I [F, 24] had a falling out with friend [F, 23], have anxiety when I need to see her in group situations. Help!
POST: I'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.
A few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.

However, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.

Normally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.

Has anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. 

Do you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now? I didn't want to stir drama but was thinking that maybe at least some of my close friends

We've seen each other a couple of times since our mutual breakup and he has helped me through some tough personal times since then, but things got really hard for me after I slept with him over a weekend trip away with some mutual friends. I just miss him and regret ever agreeing to our mutual breakup without ever really voicing what I wanted. 

I'd like to think that we will still remain close and supportive friends, and I hope we do, but being able to see his Facebook and follow his every move was just destroying me and making my depression all the more difficult to deal with. Which is why I've (finally) decided to start NC and just get on with myself. I've unfriended him and it was hard but very liberating. I know I'll certainly see him in person in the near future again due to our mutual friends and common interests, but knowing that I don't have to speak to him again unless it's on my terms is both painful and good.

TITLE: [NSFW] BF [22 m] and I [23 f] can't agree on this boundary
POST: Together 2 years.  I'm using a throw away because this is a bit of an awkward problem I don't want associated with my main.

My boyfriend and I are pretty good at compromising, and have always been good about approaching the problem as a team. However, the current discussion we're having is something we've been unable to compromise on.

My boundaries are pretty strongly associated with interaction. So while I have no problem with my bf looking at porn or gonewild or whatever, commenting or messaging someone on those or other mediums is not okay. 

I found out fairly recently that my bf downloaded mods for a popular game that allow you to ""have sex"" with other characters, and that he had specifically downloaded characters, characters with certain appearances, and some characters resembling celebrities. 

When I found this out I was very upset. Maybe a bit of an overreaction, but I think that's because I saw his comments on subreddits talking about these mods and characters, and a comment that basically crossed the line for me because it was on a nsfw photo album. 

We discussed it, we cried. I reiterated my strong feelings about interaction and commenting and he apologized and said he understood. He suggested he should uninstall the game and mods.

Now he wants to reinstall the game, and had been planning on re-installing the same mods. 

We can't come to a compromise. He feels that the modding is basically porn and is therefore fair game and none of my business. I feel that the modding (and involvement with selecting new mods, new characters and involvement with the modding community) is too interactive and is something I'm not comfortable with, as I feel it crosses the boundaries of our relationship.

Anyways, up until yesterday, we didn't know Gloria was available. So my buddy comes up to me a few days into it and says ""guess who swiped right?"" It was her! Now he's not very good at starting tinder conversations, so I just up and tell him to give her my number (as a joke, but play it off). I'm thinking to myself ""hell yeah I want her to have my number!"" 

Anyways, he texts ""Jimmy wants you to have his number 555-5555 and here's mine 555-5555"" and I feel like this is still in the realm of funny. But then he goes ahead and puts ""choose wisely"" which I'm worried might be too dead pan. I'm initially not too worried about it because when I last saw Gloria, we had the comfort level (with each other) of cracking sex and masturbating jokes. 

I can play this off in person, but text is pretty hard. And if we scare her from coming back it might come to this. So, over tinder, unless how can he do a follow-up to reconcile this situation and/or let her see the situation as the stupid fumbling of two young dudes that it is?

He has some trust issues, and when I mentioned bringing my ex's stuff back he fell silent. I asked him if he trusted me and he said ""I'll have to."" I asked him how I could do it to make him feel better and he suggested I tell my ex to pick up the stuff from my place. I agreed that I would try but while I think that making him feel is my first priority, I feel a little rude for asking my ex to make the trip. 

He promised he would work on these trust issues, but when I mentioned it to him, he kindly said that although he knew what kind of person I am, knew what to expect, but I had to ""build a rapport"" to maintain and prove that the trust was warranted. I was a little confused because I felt like I deserve to be trusted initially, as I trust him, but perhaps we have different viewpoints.

We value the same things, make each other laugh until we cry (or fart), love each other's families, share interests, and respect one another's personal time and space. I can see myself with this man in 60 years, two old farts having a laugh at our grandchildren's expense. He is my guy, and I am his gal. That's really all there is to it. Also, the sex is AMAZEBALLS.

I think within a year or two we will be financially ready to move into a larger place and get a dog and do all that ""pre-kids"" marriage stuff. A nice long engagement, and we're all set.

I want to propose. Personally, I think he'd get a kick out of it. He comes from a long line of feminists. I don't think he'd say ""no"", and really my biggest fear is that I'd steal his thunder. I have something truly spectacular in mind, but would like Reddit's take on it before I do something crazy.

Okay I finally talked to my wife. I was really nervous and tried to set up a good opportunity. When it got as good as I though it was going to get I just said ""So, did anything ever happen between you and dude?"" Not the smooth delivery I had hoped to make.

She said ""You mean like romantically? No, no never."" She seemed very sincere, and I believed her right away.

I went on to tell her all of the reasons I was worried, and she was very understanding. She was upset that I didn't trust her.  She did start crying when I told her about my fears that our daughter might not have been mine. She was upset that I would even think that, which is what I anticipated, and one of the main reasons I waited so long to tell her.

I put her in my shoes and asked how she would feel if a female coworker of mine acted in a similar way. It seemed like she hadn't considered that, and she admitted to being jealous and insecure in the past, which made me feel better.

She made lots of reassurances that if she was ever unhappy enough in our relationship that she would think about seeing someone else, that she would let me know things were bad way before it got to that point.

It's hard to describe how you can tell someone is telling the truth, but I could really tell. Unless she is some kind of amazing liar, which I think I would have known about after 16 years.

She did defend her douchey friend's actions a little, which I was bothered by. She said he always says things like that and doesn't really mean anything by it. I still think he's just a dipshit. I told her I didn't want to hang out with him and his wife anymore. We have moved 1200 miles away from where they are now, so it doesn't really matter.

So, yeah I am the paranoid insecure jackass that I was hoping I was.

Thank you all for your thoughts and advice.
TL;DR: ","I asked her straight out if anything had ever happened between her and tactless shithead. She told me no, very convincingly. I am the ass."

TITLE: There's something to be said for some time off
POST: Last month (July 19th to be exact) I went for a 6 mile run and totally blew my knee. I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old ""normal"" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace! I only stopped because I didn't want to go from zero to 60 and risk reinjury. I feel like a million bucks!
TL;DR: ",Took 5 weeks off for an injury and concentrated on strength training and my first day back to running was fast and easier than ever before!

TITLE: Me [20F] with my boyfriend [27 M] of 1 year, on a break because of his lost desire for sex.
POST: We went a few days without talking at all so I finally ask him what's up. He keeps saying he can't explain it but he's sorry and that the fire is gone from the relationship. We meet up to talk about it in person and he says he lately has no sex drive, asks me why we need to have sex every time we hang out (2-3 times per week usually).

This made me feel really insecure and took my self-esteem down a notch but told him I wanted to fix it. His solution was to keep on doing everything else the same but just take a break from sex to see if that fixes things. I feel that there is an underlying issue with the relationship such as him just losing interest because we've been together for a while. So I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely and see how it feels.

On my end it feels like shit. I want to call him just to talk about our day or to say I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate to him. It gets a little easier each day so I'm wondering if I should break it off completely so there's no lingering hope of getting back together. That's the only way I see myself truly moving on.

Should I stay in a relationship where he is confused about his feelings and physically uninterested? Or should I break things off and try to move on?
TL;DR: ","No sex drive on his end, wondering if this is underlying emotional problem and whether I should stay in the relationship at all."

TITLE: Person I'm dating (both 24[f]24[f]) broke our exclusivity rules. Worth saving?
POST: Been together approximately one month, however have not firmly spoken about the boundaries of the relationship apart from deleting dating apps and saying we weren't seeing anyone else. We decided we weren't ready to use any form of labels or terms yet

It's been going well, met each other's friends etc except today she discloses that she slept with someone approximately 1 week ago. It's someone who she previously was interested in a romantic relationship but rejected her. She stated that she was enjoying what we had etc, and she feels this person would not have a relationship with her,

At the moment I have let her cool off (she's feeling a lot of guilt, confusion) and have told her to have a think. I think I'm happy to continue if she is able to prioritise and choose me, and really work on this. This might involve having to drop contact with the person she cheated with However it feels so early to be having to work on our relationship. I feel like if she doesn't immediately know then it's not worth it

What would you do? Say? Would you even consider continuing? Under what conditions?

TITLE: Reddit, what kind of effect do you think that crime shows/movies might have in reducing the occurrence of thought-out, ""intelligent"" crime?
POST: I had this thought a few days ago when watching an episode of NCIS and they did the usual ""create a super high resolution image from a very low resolution image."" I got to wondering how much of it is real and how much of it is fake (or, conversely, how much might be under-exaggerated). Based on these types of shows/movies (bank robbery, conning, etc.) where the bad guy nearly 100% of the time gets caught, only an idiot would think it would be a good idea to do any of this stuff, and from my [limited] knowledge of the general criminal, I'm under the impression that they are mainly uneducated people in dire situations (or psychopaths/mentally unstable.. but I'm thinking mostly with regards the heist type of crime -- not assault or murder) that are driven to extreme lengths to make the ""easy""/""quick"" dollar. So I wondered, is it possible that these shows/movies that show the criminal, no matter how smart and creative, almost always getting caught could actually be (subconsciously or consciously) reducing the amount of more well thought through crime throughout the world?
TL;DR: ","Could broadcasting hugely technologically advanced law enforcement always being able to catch the criminals be a way of making ""smarter"" people automatically not consider a life of crime?"

TITLE: Me [23 M] don't understand my crush [25 F] absolutely anymore
POST: So I've known this girl for almost 3 years now. We dated a little while when we met, but as soon as things started to get little bit more serious, she moved to Australia for 2 years (in my defence, she had the tickets bought before we started dating).

Now last november she came back, at that time I was at sea (working in the Navy). Since February we've been seeing each other again, been to the movies, restaurants, just hung out at each other's places etc, it's been fun. 

Couple days ago I asked her, what does she think about a relationship, to which she replied that she's not really looking for anything serious. I reluctantly agreed. Since we've known each other for some time now, I won't start ignoring her just for that, better to stay friends. 

2 days ago I had a party at my place, to which she came also. By time others fell asleep, we stayed up the whole night, drank and watched some stupid cartoons and spooned like there's no freakin tomorrow (got horrible blue balls from that). For a girl, who told she's not looking for a relationship, that was kind of odd thing to do, am I looking at ""friends with benefits"" kind of invitation or something? Confused af.

POST: 5 weeks ago I came home from work and my wife told me that she would be moving out in a week and a half. 

We are in the third week of her moving out. I am in our house that we bought 2 years ago and the daily reminders of her being gone are finally settling. I feel like I am the only one trying to make this relationship work right now. My heart broke when she left and I am trying to rebuild trust in her so that we can be happy if she decides to come home. 

She has been in therapy for 2 years and I just started 4 weeks ago. I am coming to many realizations and am confronting the issues that I made in our relationship. I know that now that I have seen that fear was controlling me I never want to go back to that dark place again. She tells me that she is afraid of feeling trapped in the relationship and not being able to keep her voice to ask for what she wants. 

Tonight we had a phone call. (The happen every 2-3 nights) I asked her if she was leaning to one side or the other in terms of coming home. She is against the relationship right now. She isn't working on rebuilding the relationship, she is trying to figure out if she wants the relationship at all. 

She is the most important person in my life. I love her so much and it hurts an unthinkable amount that she doesn't want to try.

How do I maintain my trust in her with her crushing my hope so heartlessly? What do I have to say to let her know that I am making so much emotional progress and positive growth?

TITLE: [30 M] Can a relationship work with no chemistry?
POST: I'm kind of a unique situation... 30 years old never had a gf, never done anything sexual, just recently started online dating.  (Reason for my lack of experience is being extremely shy, low self esteem)  Reason I've started online dating is an attempt to salvage what's left of my life.. figured even though I wasted so much of my life at this point there's no reason I should just die as a lonely virgin, so i decided to at least TRY.

After about ~5 or so weeks I've met two girls so far, got at least one more to meet in the near future.  Problem is, I am a bit awkward (Ok, I am a lot awkward.)  I feel like I do not ""click"" with anyone, and would not really know how to flirt, etc.  Question is this: how important/real is this ""chemistry"" thing?  If I don't feel anything, is it possible to develop these feelings over time?

In other words, should I force the relationship forward just because I so desperately want one?  Or should I move on when I don't detect this ""chemistry"" thing, and have the gross audacity to actually *turn down* an attractive female when I'm a 30 year old desperate virgin?

Dating and relationships are just so alien to me and I have no idea what I'm doing or how to even interact with the opposite sex.  At times I feel I'm being irresponsible even trying, and I have no right to date anyone :/

TITLE: TIFU By trying to have two females hook up in my backyard.
POST: So this happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the back yard, replacing a damaged sprinkler head. I dug up the old one, and removed it when I noticed that the hole was slowly filling with muddy water. It was so murky, I could not see the bottom of this 5 inch deep hole. So, I get the new sprinkler, attach a 1 inch male coupling to the bottom, and then attach another 1 inch female coupling to that, so that the new sprinkler would sit a little higher, therefore be more visible while mowing. I lower this into hole, and start twisting, hoping that it will snag onto what I had assumed was another male end at the bottom.

After doing this for about 2 or 3 minutes, I am starting to get frustrated. I reach in there to feel around, but the hole is too narrow for my grizzly-like hands. I try using towels to get the water out, to no avail. I try to widen the hole by using said water to turn dirt walls into mud, so that my hand might fit better. At this point, I am ten seconds away from making the hole larger using a shovel, and possibly having more dirt and debris fall in, when I look up at the old sprinkler head. I realize my foolishness. Attached to the bottom of it is the male coupling that I had been attempting to attach my female coupling to.

I pop off the new female coupling, sink that sprinkler in, give it a good twist, and vam, bam, boosh. Filled up the hole, and am now sitting here, glad none of my friends were around. After realizing my mistake, I had it done and said with, within 1 minute.

  -relaxation 
  -zip lining (wife says zip lining is a must)
  -relatively easy travel from west coast (avoiding jet lag on such a short itinerary)
  -no car rental (fine w cabs/ trains/ bus)
  -if we're doing a relaxing vacation, I'd love if we could be on the beach
  -other activities: day hikes, snorkel, kayak??
  - good food/ drink hopefully!!

I was trying to figure out where to get started on a Costa Rica itinerary, when someone strongly suggested Nicaragua. Part of my downfall is trying to do too much, so help me keep it simple :). 1-2 locations over 8 days would be perfect.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my romantic interest [18 F] 2 weeks, not sure what to do
POST: Hello /r/relationships. I've been dating this girl for 2 weeks (only had one date, we're both in the army so it's kinda complicated), but we've known each other for two years, and been great friends for over a year. We've had a hiatus after some ugly things surfaced, but lately we got in touch, and I decided to ask her out, because I'm 18 and never actually had a girlfriend or even a date before.

So we went out and whatnot, but no touching or whatever occurred. While I'd usually be concerned she's not interested in me, knowing her personality, she's quite shy and somewhat fears touching and whatnot, so it's understandable. 

Tomorrow we're going on another date, and I was wondering if to just flow with the situation, or somewhat push forwards and ask her if she wants a more serious relationship, i.e. actually be a couple. While she shies away from contact, when you approach her with these things, she's honest and says whatever's on her mind. So I was wondering if I should or shouldn't do so - because we've been good friends for over a year, we know each other well, so is it worth bothering going on regular dates or should I just try and ""force"" the issue on her?

I have no doubt in her, nor her in I. And she did say yes to my proposal.

However, my parents, and her parents both know that we have only been together about a month now, and I am just curious how it is we should clue them in on this situation in the least freak the hell out sort of way possible...

POST: While in HS I worked at a theme park over several summers.  I went back one more year in college and a former supervisor had been promoted to a very high up position.  I was living close to his house and he asked if I wanted to hang out sometime.  I didn't think anything of it.  I knew he and his wife had divorced and figured he wanted to have an excuse to go to the bar.  

We had a few drinks and went back to his place for a couple more drinks as the bar closed.  He switched from beer to some heavily poured mixed drinks at a fast pace.  He began to talk about his life and got into some DEEP shit, and got emotional.  I just kept listening trying not to be a douche, thinking maybe I am helping.  Then he started saying ""I haven't felt so close to anyone like this before"".  I said ""that's understandable, you are talking about some heavy stuff"". He kept going saying "" I feel like I want to hug you.  Maybe hold you if you want to sit over here"".  I told him I was comfortable where I was.  He kept going and I politely got up to leave and he changed his tune quickly.  He tried to give me a hug at the door but I switch it to a handshake.  I felt bad but not much I could do.  He was ten years older, two levels higher than my boss, and most importantly I am straight.

A couple of weeks later I did something at work that would have been cause for immediate termination (one of those bureaucratic safety things where no one could have been hurt but it's just a rule).  He was in charge that day and he changed the violation to a lesser offense that allowed me to keep my job.

TITLE: My girlfriend [20F] and I [22M] of over 1 Year are having issues regarding differing views on Sex before marriage and living together. I really need some advice or other experiences here, please help Reddit.
POST: Essentially, my girlfriend believes in the whole Sex after Marriage and no Living together till marriage whilst I believe the opposite and after 1 Year and 2 months it's starting to get messier. 

To start off, a little back story; my girlfriend is of Christian background and I'm not, and she did tell me she didn't want sex before marriage about 4 months into the relationship. A but late, but I respect people's decisions and don't want to push them into these things. She's a Virgin, I'm not, but I thought this girl was awesome and though ""fuck it, not worth breaking up just because she doesn't want sex"". 

So recently, Valentine's day, I (stupidly) brought up the situation of living together and sex before marriage, I always saw sex as an important part of a relationship and a way to intimately connect with your S/O and express your love. I also feel that living together before marriage is a great test, because some people cannot stand living together even when in a relationship. My girlfriend believes all this should happen after marriage. 

A part of me feels like it's her parents who are also heavily influencing her decisions, she always brings it back to disappointing her parents with her decisions. Whilst I respect that, some times I feel her parents are controlling her indirectly. Am I wrong to think this?

So after an argument last night, my girlfriend and I came to the point of ""do we break up, or wait till marriage"". And I'm left here really confused and stuck. I don't want to break up but at the same time I'm so worried,confused and I feel like I'm missing something now. Have you been in this situation? Do you have any advice that can help me? What are your views....I'm at a stump and I'm scared I'll make the wrong decision.

POST: Yeah I realize it is now a long time since Christmas and this part of my dilemma, which I guess is my own fault. So for Christmas my boyfriend (of ~10 months) got me a gift certificate for a ""makeover and photoshoot"".  I can't really imagine doing anything much worse than spending my day having my hair and make-up done than having my photo taken for two hours. Okay, maybe a bit dramatic but I'm really not that kind of girl and my boyfriend does know that. I guess he could be hinting that he wants me to dress up a bit more but I didn't really think he cares – I think it is more likely that someone told him it was a good gift idea or something he got for an ex that they really liked.

Anyway, I pretended I liked it and hoped he would maybe forget about it and I wouldn't have to use it. But, more recently he keeps asking me when I'm going to go and if I've booked it yet. I'm all ""oh yeah I'll do it soon I'm so busy at the moment"", which is obviously not an excuse I can carry on forever. So my question is should tell him I don't want to go? I would feel bad because it has been a long time now that I've pretended and he probably did put quite a bit of thought in what to get me. Also what if I do tell him, what would be the best way to bring it up without sounding like an ungrateful bitch? Or should just suck it up and go? Obviously I could make it through, especially if I had a drink or something before to help me enjoy it a bit more but I really don't want to. Any advice is appreciated.

TITLE: How can I convert a print book to an ebook?
POST: There's a book I'd like to read that isn't available as an ebook.  I'm perfectly willing to buy a DRM-laden ebook version of this book, but it's simply not available.  I bought hard copy of this book (actually 3 books, but that's splitting hairs) but, being a techie, I'd really much rather have an ebook.  Preferably in .pdf, .doc, .rtf, or some other flexible, easy-to-use format.

There has to be some way of turning a physical book into an ebook other than individually scanning each and every page by hand.  I'm sure there's some kind of specialized machine that can do it, but I don't have one.  I'd be more than willing to pay for temporary access to such a device; maybe mail the book away, or bring it to a Kinkos-like place.  The thing is I can't manage to find any service that does this.  Maybe my google-fu is weak, but all I can find are websites and programs that convert one ebook format to another, and 1 or 2 services that are only intended for authors/copyright holders (and they make you sign a thing certifying that you are such).
TL;DR: ",I own a physical paper book that I legally bought and paid for.  I'd like to convert it into an ebook.  How can I easily do it?

TITLE: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men - How do I overcome this adversity and make this pooch at least tolerate me?
POST: Been seeing this girl and it's gotten the point where we're sleeping at each others places.  She has this dog, kind of a poodle or something (not exactly sure on the breed, small, white, kind of curly hair).  She (dog) is cool in the dog park, pretty decent on a leash, but in her own dwelling, does not like men.

Dog has no history of abuse by men, but the dog does not like men.  She is pretty territorial and barks when I even get close to her closet door (where she keeps the dog when I'm around, it's a huge closet, no sketchy neglect or anything).

Getting to the point where I have to meet this small beast and make nice-nice.  What is the best way to do so?  Apparently, she nips at hands/heels and will just stare me down and growl the entire time.  Should I arrive with treats?  I've raised pups on my own and never had a problem but mostly German shepherds and Dobermans.  Never thought I'd struggle with a poodle.  

Any help or tips would be great.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my fiancée [27 F] 3 years, she proposed to me over a year ago and has been pressuring me to ""counter propose"" ever since.
POST: Our relationship has been great the past 3 years.  We rarely fight and we have a lot of fun together.

Backstory: over a year ago I ended up helping her with a medical issue and took her to the hospital to be treated for dehydration.  Carrying her in my arms, the whole nine yards.  She felt extreme gratitude afterwards and decided to throw tradition out the window by buying a pair of wedding rings and proposed to me, taping the whole thing using her laptop and recited a speech for me.  She liked it, so she put a ring on it.

We've been pumped about getting married ever since then, and have been waiting for her to be done with graduate school before we officially drop the money to tie the knot.

The problem is that in my mind, and from what we've been telling everyone, we are officially engaged and that she proposed to me.  She's been wanting me ever since to do a counter-proposal, where I basically propose back, and have a whole long written confession of my love for her.  Now, I obviously have no problem in doing so, but she said she feels like until I do so our engagement is ""fake"" (her words).

I feel like it's a bit messed up to have that sentiment.  Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I think that whatever proposal I come up with is just going to fall flat of her expectations, considering the magic of the surprise will not be there.  Not to mention, it kind of kills the mood if she is literally *asking* me to propose to her.

Am I being an asshole?

TITLE: I (27m) am dating a married woman (27f) and we've been seeing each other for four months now. I don't know what to do.
POST: I'll keep this brief. I always wanted to be married, want a family and kids, that hasn't changed. Dating has been crappy for me as I've been so focused on working since I come from a very poor family. I'm 27 now, doing well with my career (well enough for now anyways) so I have more ""time"" for dating.

Used Tinder for a while, had some fun flings, met a chick who was in an ""open marriage"" and just wanted to date. I thought it would be easy sex, went along with it. One thing led to another and now I love her, and she loves me. She admits this, but does not want to leave her husband (which was the first guy she ever dated, and according to her friends screams at her and manipulates her and is garbage, but it's her decision)

So, she doesn't want to leave him, loves me, I love her... I've been dating her for around four months now and I've been keeping it going hoping to build a bond with her and when I can have a 'very' serious talk with her about things I'll have more of a potential for her to consider my words about our future.

I need some advice. What should I do here? Should I stop seeing her?

Oh, and a side note... I'm terrified this woman is my soul mate. I've been in love, dated... and never felt a connection in my life like I do with this woman. So there's that. (Sorry for broken jumbled post)

TITLE: Me(22F) with my sister(18F) and her boyfriend(17M) Should I say something?
POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for a little over a year now. They are each others first relationships. 

I recently got out of a 3 year abusive relationship. My anger toward my ex might be clouding my judgement but I'm not sure. 

For a while I've been noticing dysfunctional things in their relationship that remind me of my ex. Her boyfriend is acting like a typical 17 year old boy and is really into the physical aspect of their relationship. My sister is borderline verbally abusive to him. She says things like, ""I don't know why you love me, maybe you shouldn't."" I feel that she treats him poorly, is rude to him and expects way too much out of him. She tells him that we, her family hates him. I've heard them talk about getting married when he turns 18 so they can have sex without getting in trouble with my conservative Christian parents. 

My sister leaves for college in the fall and I think that's creating more strain. They fight a lot more often. 

So I'm wondering, do I say something to the boyfriend? I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen, she just assumes all my words mean I hate her relationship and her. I think there's potential for mistakes, heartbreak and regrets on both their parts and I don't want that to happen. Should I talk to her boyfriend, tell him we don't hate him, we just have concerns?

TITLE: Reddit, I need your help with an over-protective mother.
POST: I'm 17, and recently started seeing a 20 year old. We've become extremely close, and since I met him I've been much happier and more motivated to do well in other areas of my life. I already get good grades at a difficult school, play sports, and have never had problems with drinking or drugs. Our relationship is what keeps me balanced.

My parents have been divorced for several years, and I live with my dad nearly full time. My mother is a bit over-protective, so I anticipated some difficulty, but not like this. She thinks that the age difference is too great for somebody my age, and doesn't want me to date him. This, I understand; it's her prerogative to be concerned. It can be worked around. The real problem is that she is now trying to attack my dad legally for being a bad parent, neglecting my safety, etc. On top of this, she refuses to talk to me about how we can compromise, just insists that this is in my best interest in the long run. 

I've been looking for articles about how being in a stable, loving relationship is healthy for young adults (articles seem to be the best way to get through to her), but I can't find many that address the pros of teenage relationships. What I really need is to convince her that this is a healthy thing, something that falls in line with her need to 'shape me into a good young lady'.

Any ideas?

Note: ""you're 17, you're too young to be dating, just enjoy life and don't feel like you need to be with somebody..."" Yes, yes I know. This boy fell right out of the fucking sky, and I care about him and trust him more than almost anybody. I'm not going to give up on this just because of some age/family issues.

TITLE: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, but its more complex than it seems. Please help!
POST: I live with some college girlfriends in a small city in a very old home. I pay rent, utilities, (which include water, gas, heat, cable, internet, etc) and my own foodstuffs since I'm on a specific diet. I have known this girl for 5 years, and she has a boyfriend that NEVER leaves. It's not like he's a typical mid twenties burnout either - he's a teacher in a great school district, makes good money, and has his own place sans roommates less than two city blocks away. 

Basically, he is always here. Never leaves for more than his workdays and to pick up clean clothes from his place. He literally lives here, showering, cooking, doing laundry, and hanging out in the common areas even when his girlfriend isn't here. PLus, they have loud sex every night, which doesn't really bug me, but its getting a little annoying when you have early mornings and you are awoken to a slamming headboard at 2am every night...

Here is the real problem though. Many other sites that address this problem suggest that the boyfriend should chip in with rent and/or utilities. Here is the kicker - the roommate doesn't pay rent since its her fathers place. She has a joint bank account with her Dad (who is my landlord) to which she pays me the utilities that are in my name. She is a new grad and unemployed, so I know she isn't paying rent with her own money.

Myself and the third roommate are getting seriously frustrated. We both work hard at out entry level jobs to make ends meet, plus the work in maintaing the house. I basically feel like I am financing their love nest, and I'm sick of it. 

Sorry that was so long, I feel much better getting all that out.

So my girlfriend is in our home town at the moment and I'll be traveling there to see her.

My parents would react extremely surprised and would immediately want to know everything about her and meet her the same day.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my _Friend__ [23 F] 2 years of something confusing
POST: These past couple of years I had it very rough when it came to socializing and being happy. Well, friends kinda used some drugs and I was left alone for a while I later found out...but, before that....

I started to stay away from it as I lost confidence, had low self esteem,etc. I eventually and mutually met someone. I was shy but she was outgoing so I guess it evened out somehow.Asked me alot about myself and it felt good. We were going to be meeting more often so next time....when that came she randomly came over and hugged me and introduced me to some friends. We talked for a bit,said she was a bit concerned with her apperance and then she blurts out...let me give you my number, we will get lunch soon which we did. Went well. 

I bonded with her more and more as I saw her, got a random selfie with her which was odd, but also was called sweet for a thank you I gave her. 

Now there was times she was very rude or inconsiderate. She is known by others to be immature but I look past that most of the time as she did help me out. 

The weirdest event was her kinda following me. I was going to a game with friends and invited her and her friends like a week in advance. Gave her a heads up and she said she was busy, so I left it at that. I go to the game and was walking around and look down and saw her and all her friends. Okay someone else could have had an idea to go but come on that was a bit weird that she showed up then and there when she basically said no. 

I dont want to go into too much detail to things unless needed but I didnt know if I was being played here or she liked me or it was her personality or I dont even know what. I personally grew to like her but have not seen her in a while for certain reasons.

TITLE: Has screen-sharing been throttled on Skype and are there alternatives?
POST: Hello friends!

I am in a long distance relationship and as such Skype has been a major boon to the quality of our lives. This has been downgraded somewhat recently.

Me and my girlfriend would screen-share so we could enjoy movies and episodes together. It might not seem like much but we cherished the ability. I subscribed to the Skype service solely to keep that for us. 

Some time ago screen-sharing just stopped being able to cope with running video. I think this was around the time Microsoft acquired Skype although I'm not sure. This is confounding since both of us still enjoy good web connections and use high definition webcams that stream very well under normal conditions. 

Furthermore we have discovered that if we screen-share for any reason our call is seemingly throttled and we have to recall to regain quality.

I have googled this to no avail and I was wondering if anybody has any knowledge about this situation and/or knows a working alternative?

TITLE: I (M20) don't know of SO (F19) of 4 years is being fair.
POST: A few months ago, we had a pretty big argument. She was upset over it, and I asked her repeatedly if there was anything that I could do to help. She said that she was fine and during the week we had tons of fun so I genuinely believed she was fine. The next few days she messaged me telling me that she's horribly sad, and that she can't believe that I let her feel sad when we were together. 
(Oh! Quick note, she lives in a college a few hours away, and comes to visit every other weekend along with her best friend.) 
Now, this isn't the first time she gas done this, this happens weekly, where she does not communicate clearly how she's feeling and what she wants me to do, then she explodes on me. 
I was furious that she would have the nerve to tell me that I didn't try to make her feel better when I had at one point begged for her to tell me how she was really feeling, so I ended things with her compulsively (over text, so a total dick move on my part). She then called me a few seconds later telling me she was sorry and that she was wrong. I told her that I made a super compulsive decision when I ""ended things"" and that I was sorry and didn't mean it at all. That I just acted without thinking.
Everything was fine and dandy, until recently.
 This is the problem:
Now she's telling me that she is VERY sad because I broke up with her (even after I apologized to her for doing so, and practically begged her to believe that I didn't mean it) and she says that she is feeling insecure about the relationship because I had ""ended things."" She wants me to make it up to her by doing this grand gesture for her as a way of showing her that I really do love her (which I do) and to make her secure of this relationship. She wants me to make her feel better. And she's very upset that I have not done it yet.

Is that fair of her? I don't understand how it could be, but maybe I'm wrong. And what can I do to solve this issue?

I'm 27 and she is 28.  We've been together 2 1/2 yrs. and we live together.

Yesterday she got mad at me over the phone for not wanting to go to the beach the next day (she was on a lunch break). After we hung up she texted me and said I never try to spend time with her. I apologized and said let's go. She said she was over it and will go with friends. 

After that she texts me and says she is going out after work with friends and wont be home until late. She also said she can't go to my friends wedding next week. 

She doesn't come home  till midnight last night and when she walks in she doesn't speak to me and proceeds to watch tv in the living room and then she slept on the couch. 

In the morning I wake and she is in the bed. I try to hug her but she pushes me away and says  nothing. I fall back asleep. When I wake up again she is in the living watching tv. I say good morning and she doesn't reply back. 

Now I'm in the bedroom and she is on the couch watching tv. I don't want to fight with her but I want us to talk out the situation.

TITLE: TIFU by flooding my classroom and forcing my entire class outside for 2 weeks.
POST: Okay so to start things off this didn't happen today, more like 12 years ago. 

So I went to a small country primary school in Ireland. We had maybe 200 students total, if even that and my class (6th class, highest grade in the school, we were all roughly 12) shared a room with 5th class. The school is just outside of a small town and on rare occasions the water would turn off completely. This has only happened maybe twice while I was at the school.

One day the water went, towards the end of the school day. We had PE outside at the end of the day and afterwards some of us stayed playing until we were getting picked up. I went in to get my stuff before going home and went to wash my hands. Turned the tap on but nothing came out. At this stage the school was basically empty and the teachers were gone home. I didn't notice that the plug was in the sink and didnt think to turn the tap off again as there was no water coming out.

Shoot forward to the following morning and the room is completely flooded. The room is about 90% carpet so that is completely soaked and starting to stink. Its early june at this point and while I know Irish weather gets a bad rep it was a nice summer. We had to spend the last 2 weeks of school outside (literally no there room in the school for us) and while we did do some actual work we mostly got to play. We had taken our exams for secondary school already so there was nothing to study for. 

I never told anyone it was me but I knew immediately that I had done it. I spose it worked out for me but I know it probably cost the school a good bit of money seeing as it was a small school. Principal also took the blame for it cause she used to check to make sure the taps were off to avoid this. Felt bad for her but it was pretty good for me.
